Vitalik is a pioneer to all crypto most coins wouldn‚Äôt be here if it wasn‚Äôt for him nor would this large ecosystem of ERC20. Without his project we wouldn‚Äôt of had a 2017 bull run like we did. Show some respect my man. This guy is a innovative genius.

that's the thing, the moment people actually starts to use it it collapses and we've had to use Ethereum, ZCash and BCH for actual payments back when the mempool was huge and fees went to $20, and the LN is too complex and centralized, so perhaps BTC collapses on its own

I've known that most altcoins are a scam pretty much from the beginning.
People trying to sell Dogecoin Dark as the next Bitcoin cemented that belief.
That doesn't mean I can't make money trading it.
Them being a scam makes it even easier to trade.
