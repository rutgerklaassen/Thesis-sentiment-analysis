bitcoin is more self-reliance, individual self-sovereignty & trusting math/crypto. so it's really not strength in numbers (other than numbers as a pun for math, but then why strength, why not self-sovereignty or trust. i like ""don't trust, verify"" and ""in crypto we trust"" better.

These are just a handful of the 44+ new altcoins created in the same manner as the Bcash altcoin. There are simply too many to illustrate here. None of them offer any real utility. The only real difference between these altcoins is their marketing budgets. https://blog.bitmex.com/44-bitcoin-fork-coins/…

the only reason anyone measures it on transaction count is bitcoin advocates saying ""BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ENERGY THE EXISTING FINANCE SYSTEM USES"", so someone responds w how much each system actually does for the energy use, i.e. lots for the normal system and v. little for bitcoin

I don't get why he sees Bitcoin cash as better than all the other alts and forks. Bch is the original scam fork. That scandal made me wish I never signed up to coinbase. 
Basically all this prick is doing is screwing up the alt market for personal gain

that's cool. btw i have been wondering if ""vires in numeris"" may not the best phrase to have latin for as ""strength in numbers"" means normally like ""mob rule"" ? or ""popular uprising defeats"" where bitcoin is more like ""in crypto we trust"" whatever the latin for that would be.
