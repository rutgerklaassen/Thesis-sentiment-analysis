I understand some current Bitcoiners might not like this, but we have to move forward and adapt Bitcoin to regular people - not the other way around. At least, that's our view, I'm sure others will create great products for present-day Bitcoiners.

I put ethereum in the ""almost default alive"" category, due to also having good momentum. Reasons for not being default alive:
- Uncertainty around monetary policy, full PoS, sharding
- Competitors only a couple of years behind, at most
- No really sticky killer apps yet

Hi I‚Äôm BitCoin.  

Miners get rewards in me for whoever can waste electricity the fastest.  

It was supposed to be a path to decentralized consensus. It failed miserably. 

So now people just use me to pay the Chinese to waste energy the fastest. 

I am a centralized failure.

We might be wrong, but I don't want to try the same formula that hasn't worked for 10 years all over again. Our goal is not to create a good Bitcoin wallet, but to reinvent how money works.
