Lots of segwit/core supporters here, harping at Vinny for not endorsing Blockstream coin. 

""Why...Vinny why...how can you say that....""

If someone like Vinny and a whole bunch of other people like him are supporting Bitcoin Cash, don't you think there's a good reason to it?

Apples to orange. I don't recall any respectable, well known, social media influencer, e.g. Vinny, promoting Bitconnect. Failed. 

Grasping too hard w/ the Madoff. 

Bitcoin Cash is none of those things. It's closer to the original Bitcoin than any other coin here.

Agree 100% on the effects of Bitcoin, disagree on the cause.  Being the best isn't even a necessary condition of it's success...it can simply mean that it was the first tech that was good enough.

Good call on $ZRX but it's hard to take anyone who supports Bitcoin Cash seriously (sorry). It might feel good, at the time, but like late night street food you're going to regret it when the sun comes up.
