Yes^ + unlike bitcoin or ether, where the success isn't dependent upon any particular entity but token users and developers contribute to the value of the system, with XRP, its success depends on Ripple getting banks & FIs to use it. An XRP holder can't convince a bank to use XRP

How is that centralisation..? If it would only cost $1MM to get XRP listed on Coinbase - hell, there are hundreds of individual XRP holders who‚Äòd each be happy to pay the entire bill. Would be the same with Bitcoin, if it wasn‚Äòt already on Coinbase.

The comments of that Tweet prove we're in a simulation. It's like a copy paste of every bitcoin discussion ever. Do they actually think they are re-hashing things people don't yet know? Does either side think they are going to convert the other? They are all NPCs.
