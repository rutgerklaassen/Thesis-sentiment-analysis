That's okay Marty - if you think the Ethereum community is being duped then let them be duped. Why do you care so much? Bitcoiners talk about Ethereum too much.

Bitcoin is one of the few investment opportunities w/ the upside traditionally only available to VCs. I wasn‚Äôt an accred investor in 2013. If Bitcoin were limited to accredited investors, my life would be very different. I‚Äôd like to see everyone have this opportunity across mkts.

I think this is the narrative shift I want to represent. It's ok to be confident and excited about Ethereum without being a maxi and without agreeing to endure endless misinformation campaigns from the wider crypto community.

I find it very bizarre that a pro-Ethereum tweetstorm that doesn't disparage any other project became so popular and slightly contentious simply because we dare to be confident about Ethereum's potential success.
