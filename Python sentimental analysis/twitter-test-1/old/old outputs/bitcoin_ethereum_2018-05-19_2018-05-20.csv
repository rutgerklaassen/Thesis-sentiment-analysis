The image you found amusing was just an Image I put together to help raise awareness for their community :) Im sure there was a time where many people in Crypto had just heard of Bitcoin for their first time too. We're all at different stages in this.

I have to tell the young guys in my office that ""not shaving"" isn't the same as having a beard. 

One can make you look like a serious gentleman, the other like a half-wit who wants to talk about Bitcoin.

To take a page from Roger's book, I was a millionaire before Bitcoin. And I've held much more in BTC than LTC and have been public about that since the beginning.

Bitcoin doesn't need to win over you or me specifically. It needs to win over investors generally. It's doing that phenomenally well, beyond my wildest expectations.
