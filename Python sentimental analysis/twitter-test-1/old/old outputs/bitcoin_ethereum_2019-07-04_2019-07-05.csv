I would say that many of those Bitcoiners have projects of their own, but they are not naturally monetizable, so they default to evangelizing bitcoin itself, whereas people building on ethereum are much more likely to shill their specific project.

Electrifying more gadgets in our lives means more energy consumption, although efficiency disguised some of it

There's one perspective that Bitcoin need not do anything else in order to become a global reserve currency: all it needs to do is nothing as it watches other systems inevitably fail under the follies of fickle fallible humans. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1146423819906748416…

Acquiring an entire #bitcoin today sets you back about $12,000

Imagine studying this thing for a long time and realizing..this shits going to $1million per coin someday, and way beyond..

And NOT doing everything you can to get your hands on more satoshis?

Your comments don't have much substance. Decred is a good plan B. If bitcoin can't evolve quick enough, Decred is a good back up for the world. Being able to adapt quickly may be very important in the future. Makes no sense to have all eggs in one basket.
