In the era before Bitcoin, these people were a real threat. They could whip up a mob in the name of ""democracy"" and do real damage to people. There are many examples of this in the 20th Century, all of them reprehensible, horrible and sickening.

Flippenings incoming everywhere. New Tether has also been printed almost exclusively on Ethereum lately.

ERC20/Ethereum USDT is now already up to almost 40% of Omni/Bitcoin USDT.

Nobody wants to be Bitcoin anymore, but altcoins are still engaged in one-ups-manship.

I think altcoins can organize in ways Bitcoin never could.

The format isn't important.

It's the fact that Dave and Craig (the alleged creators of Bitcoin) authored a white paper together prior to the publishing of the Bitcoin white paper.

Its going to be like a black hole when $ETH goes parabolic. Market cap feeding frenzy. It usually happens shortly after $BTC #bitcoin ends off its parabolic. Which it just did. 

That said, I'm banking on #ethereum retracing a bit more, first order.

Software doesn't require their help, and Bitcoin in particular was designed to be resistant to it and is an explicit repudiation of ""governance"". This is why democracy advocates loathe Bitcoin, and will never ever accept it, sinking so low as to call Bitcoiners ""Fascists"".

Their way of participating in the creative act is to attach themselves like leeches on the bodies of the creative and productive. They can't produce anything themselves, so they assert there is a need for ""democratic governance"". With Bitcoin, they have never been so misguided.
