Wasabi is similar in its approach. They use Chaumian CoinJoin, while CashShuffle is based on CoinShuffle. Wasabi has done good work, and are similar in many ways, but the way they actually do the obfuscation is different. Also it's BCH or Bitcoin Cash.

I think dapp and ICO skepticism has led many Bitcoiners to underestimate the usefulness of having a flexible layer-1 platform for verification of arbitrary protocols. Bitcoin Script isn‚Äôt very good at verification! It can‚Äôt even check a Merkle path, or a signature on data.

Blockchain Commons is working on a proof-of concept reference implementation of an air-gapped iOS bitcoin wallet. It uses an iPod Touch or old sim-less iPhone that is  administratively-locked network disabled to create keys & sign transactions, and only communicates via QR codes.
