It's being really annoying to use

 @binaryFate01 why is Monero labeling itself as a ‚Äúprivacy coin‚Äù? Shouldn‚Äôt the label be ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù? Is cash ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù money? No. Monero is digital cash. Bitcoin is ‚Äúnon-private‚Äù digital cash, which happens to be a contradiction

I honestly don't have a clue what these people want anymore: how does one believe Bitcoin will destroy the elites, but then also, the elites need to buy it, but then also, the elites will drive the price down, but then also, new paradigm? Like, the f*ck are they even on about?

Somebody needs to find the record of the people who have been rejected and build a bitcoin business around them! The sample we've seen in this thread suggests the rest would make a great team!
