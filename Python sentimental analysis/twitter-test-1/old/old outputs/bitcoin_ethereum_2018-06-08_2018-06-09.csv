Follow the hashrate. The hashrate keeps going higher. Price always follows hashrate. Every currency in the world is crashing against #Bitcoin (at varying speeds).

I remember the reason I made the switch from Apple to Android was when they initially banned Bitcoin wallets on the app store in 2014. I'm curious how many early crypto adopters did the same.

Thanks for listening! I agree, my immediate reaction was that - if ethereum really can't deliver on its promises, then it should collapse on its own. I just don't like arguing with guests, because I want our podcast to be very guest-friendly

‚ÄúGetting‚Äù federal agents to ‚Äútake down‚Äù anything is very bad ‚Äî especially in a case where it‚Äôs a voluntary transaction and no violence or involuntary taking of property was involved.

Most peaceful views seems: ETH has a right to exist just as much as diet pills or Bitcoin.

There's even a generic out-of-the-box implementation for it! https://github.com/paragonie/chronicle‚Ä¶

Honestly, I don't know where people get this idea from that 'transparency' is somehow uniquely provided by blockchains. Solutions for this far predate Bitcoin.

Hard to engage with him since he blocked us.

These transactions worked fine when Bitcoin started and for years after that

These are not new transactions.

This is the definition of economic planning in action.

There's also a certain kind of stoicism. People taking aggressive action within the government against Ethereum is outside of my control, as is people outside the government agitating them.
