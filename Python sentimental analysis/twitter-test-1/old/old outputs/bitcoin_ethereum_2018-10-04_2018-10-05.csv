Means that there is a possibility that there will be ETFs to trade both long and short in Bitcoin soon..   which would make a further point of it being a financial asset or at least a commodity.
This means, that investors that haven't been able to invest or trade in it can do it.

Alt season is when bitcoin dominance drops drastically.

Its highest was 57%
And hit a low of 50%. 
Currently at 52%

The end of the alt seasons was around 35% btc dominance.

I complete agree with 2. CTOR and other premature optimisation is stupid. Bitcoin is good enough as it is. The block size limit has to go ASAP! As long as the limit is there, nothing will ever happen.

Run (and use!) a full node. Be opinionated about the rules that node enforces. And don't give your business to companies that try to corrupt bitcoin governance. That's pretty much it! :D
