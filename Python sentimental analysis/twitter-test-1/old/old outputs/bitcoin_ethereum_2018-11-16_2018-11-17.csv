Looks like the whole premise of miners decide is wrong. Just like last year, devs trump miners, because it is they who are more representative of user opinions.  One day it will sink in, CSW is wrong, indirectly it is users who control Bitcoin

Bitcoin ABC is currently 56.8% ahead in proof of work done. It's NOT about blocks, it's about accumulated work. You could actually even be blocks ahead, it wouldn't matter. Due to difficulty adjustments it's completely normal we're close on blocks. Only accumulated work matters.

I seriously don't believe it's for the good of Bitcoin if you base your decisions on protocol on what one guy does. 

If you know something is a bad choice, and you continue, it's on yourself. ABC chose to continue. It's not Craig, it was ABC.
