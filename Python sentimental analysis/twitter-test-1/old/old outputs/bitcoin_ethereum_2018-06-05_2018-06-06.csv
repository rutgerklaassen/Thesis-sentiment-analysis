The original narrative of Bitcoin being a defense mechanism against government has turned into a communist mechanism of preventing successful people having a bigger share. BTC Core ""decentralization"" is a communist ""force equal outcomes"" in disguise.

Finally published a draft of the mining protocols I've been working on for a while today. Lots of potential to make mining more effecient, more secure, and more decentralized. https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bips/blob/betterhash/bip-XXXX.mediawiki‚Ä¶ Also discussions at http://talesfromthecrypt.libsyn.com/tales-from-the-crypt-31-matt-corallo‚Ä¶ and https://youtu.be/dpCEa6NB7to

XRP can't be mined and can only  be burned when xrapid is in production so the only way it can go is up. Bitcoin can not be burned so if you hold it long enough xrp circulation could be lower than btc

Yes!  Bitcoin could fail also!  It‚Äôs the least likely to fail in crypto and has the most defenses but anything is possible - this is the early stages of a major global shift - nothing is certain.

There are several more companies now with miners: 
@HalongMining
 #gmo, and Samsung will make them too.  What is the problem? 

If there is a lucrative industry, competition for those profits will arise.  Jihan was just early, he believed in Bitcoin early, took risks, was rewarded.

I guess, if you think about it, it is a true brokerage in that regard. Just like their custody of stock you would never take off of there. It's not a bad deal if you are a Bitcoin or Ethereum day trader. Not for hodlers, methinks.

Why not Bitcoin? Ask the thousands of developers building on Ethereum versus the handful on Bitcoin. Perhaps developers actually see through the narrative you're trying to perpetuate with this hit piece?
