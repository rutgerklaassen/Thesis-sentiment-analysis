Here's a price comparison of #bitcoin on MtGox vs Bitstamp in 2012-14. There's definitely a MtGox risk premium toward the end, but it wasn't sustained until the very end (Jan 2014)--& even then it was small given its impending insolvency. Thanks

15/ ...collateralized. Any re-lending/re-pledging of collateral creates an unbacked claim to #bitcoin, which suppresses its price by satisfying real demand with a phantom version (an IOU, not the real thing).

Consider probably everyone that is in BSV used to be BTC. Many advocated it for years. Why were they into Bitcoin in the first place? Why did they change? What did they see? Why is what they say/do so consistent over time? Why do they reject SW, LN, CDSV, CTOR? Why whitepaper?

Assuming LN channel capacity remains a small part of AUM for a Bitcoin Bank, a proof of reserve tool like this (https://blockstream.com/2019/02/04/en-standardizing-bitcoin-proof-of-reserves/…) gets us a lot of the way there. However banks may also need to prove ownership of BTC locked in LN channels. Interesting challenge.

What's great about Bitcoin SV'er tweets is the ease of mind.

Let me elaborate;

When BTC'ers have proof of social media acceptance and reactions of high volume,  this (https://coinspice.io/news/blockstream-board-member-apologizes-for-russian-bot-campaign-in-alabama/…) is forever in my mind.
