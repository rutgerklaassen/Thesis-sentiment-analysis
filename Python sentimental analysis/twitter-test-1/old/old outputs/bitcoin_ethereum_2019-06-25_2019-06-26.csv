The great thing about #Ethereum is that it's permissionless!

So nobody gives a shit what you think, keep trolling tho

And BTC is NOT Bitcoin. Not a peer to peer digital cash. Not a chain of digital signatures. Soon not a transparent ledger.

It's someone's crooked idea of what they thought Bitcoin should have been, turned into a temporary market darling by dotcom bubble dynamics and deception.

Wait...

Where did #shortthebankers go?

You #longthebankers all of a sudden if they buy Bitcoin?

You people really sell your souls for money.

Yeah I’m doing my research and XRP is into some deep stuff. There are just too many top dogs involved in XRP at the highest levels. The more I read the more I’m realizing #xrp is not competing with #bitcoin. They are both trains but on different tracks.

1/ Five years from now it will be widely recognized that the major financial players in the ""cryptocurrency space"" (mostly exchanges) made a strategic error in pursuing a horizontal business opportunity rather than a vertical one.
