Bitcoin is no more real than other currency. If group set value how much a bitcoin is worth, it nearly the same when a government sets value for their currency. There’s is nothing tangible about either currency.

No. Let me be very clear. I don't see that happening.
It's extremely hard to push someone out of a permissionless system built from real open source.

Best time to have bought bitcoin was at .35 cents in 2009 either way There will still be a massive rise in BTC but the early adopters had more buying power for the same money. Safex is an investment you can benefit from without selling thanks to the dividends. Genius

The Bitcoin Cash community have a habit of doing regular scheduled upgrades every 6 months. The next one is scheduled already.

A fork is not necessarily a persistent coin split, and upgrades usually aren't.
