 so I just ordered one of these:

Curious to see how it performs.  It's based on the BM1880 (https://sophon.ai/product/introduce/bm1880.html…) and sophon is from the guys who make bitcoin mining ASICs (Bitmain).

Working with Fenbushi was an attempt to support the ethereum and crypto ecosystem. Along with genuinely valuable projects it ended up supporting stuff I don't think deserves to be supported, I could have acted differently to avoid those mistakes and really wish I did.

An ETF would be a major upgrade to ways in which investors access Bitcoin today. Here is what an ETF brings to Bitcoin:

What an #ETF brings to #Bitcoin:
-Increased liquidity via the AP & ETF ecosystem
-Lower counter-party risk
-Better valuation and execution practices 
-Separation of duties: trading, custody, valuation
-Lower fees
-Compliance with global regulations 
-Asset mgmt experience

And yet people still buy gold, diamonds, and other items that have little use or value outside of niche industrial applications. #Bitcoin is weightless, massless, volumeless, instantly transferable, gold. You could store all 21M coins on a business card and no one would know.

It's bittrex, so they would not be selling Bitcoin. And the wallet has a total output of 4,700. So I don't know where the f*** a quarter of a million comes from.

If I was an alien I'd accept only bitcoin, largest hashrate (which eventually I can game with my alien hardware), quite difficult to social engineer, for sure I wouldn't accept fiat because it would be a strong declaration of preference for one or a group of countries
