I don't see how this is bullish. It means that miners are holding large inventories in order to avoid crashing the price. They must have a big reserve, but eventually they'll want to realize gains and need to cover costs.

Jesse, the opposite is true. We are not limited by the amount of gold, we are limited by the time/cost of extraction. If we had unlimited time/money we could extract huge amounts of gold. Bitcoin, on the other hand is absolutely limited and will never exceed 21 million coins.

Even if BTC went to under 2K ‚Ç¨ it would still be much eaiser to buy/sell and transfer to outside the country than USD!
