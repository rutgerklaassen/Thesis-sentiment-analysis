Their talk at 
@ethstatus
 hackathon last year blew me away, it’s amazing to see real viable product world use cases gaining traction in ethereum already. Also their main credit identity solutions seem really exciting when it gets close or at least cool as an alternative.

Wellllll kinda, but while there are many flavors of vodka, there’s only one flavor of Bitcoin (and it’s not called “Bitcoin Core”. It’s just Bitcoin).

Other than that, sweet image!

I’ve routinely used “sats” and “satoshis” for years in various circles and never met someone who didn’t know what I meant. I don’t think anyone needs work “learning” about this. I guess some people don’t know by heart how many sats in a bitcoin, but google can answer that.
