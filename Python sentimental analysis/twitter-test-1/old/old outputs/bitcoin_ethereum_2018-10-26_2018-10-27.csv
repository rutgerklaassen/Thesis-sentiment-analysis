Launched in 2014 and already spawned many clones, including QTUM which has held a high market cap while many similar sized projects based on PoW got 51% attacked. :P

16/ The biggest downside of PoS is that it is more complicated than PoW and less battle-tested. So it will take a few years of experimentation to get this right. But many high-quality PoS projects are about to launch.

If I sell my Bitcoin, are you going to be alright? I mean, we’re BOTH OWNERS of Bitcoin. We have that in common. Ripple is a holder of XRP, as am I. What they do with their crypto is none of my business. Just like what I do with mine is none of yours.
Deal with it.

You mean private Ripple sales.  OTC will correlate to the open market via arbitrage.  And being upset at Ripple for selling XRP is like being mad at the Bitcoin protocol for rewarding miners.  XRP distribution has to happen somehow, or the coin flops.
