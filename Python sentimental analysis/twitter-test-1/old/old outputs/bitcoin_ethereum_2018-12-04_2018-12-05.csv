Every bitcoin sell off consolidates bitcoin ownership into stronger hands, reduces liquidity, and preps the next bull cycle. Ethereum is the better one to invest in. Either way this is a great time to buy, it will go back up. HODL!

Xrp army lol.. you don't care about crypto, you care about your sub dollar investment so you can ""get rich."" If xrp surpasses Bitcoin, crypto is dead. 

Xrp is a settlement system and does not need to increase in value. There is no use for it that a bank can't do themselves.

How about this, we some how convinced people that ""hold"" bitcoin that a $3,000 price tag is ""bearish"", while a year ago, the same price level was considered outrageously bullish. Time skews perspective and advantages the bold, it is why value has a habit of flowing to the few.

#Bitcoin was the 1st.

It is the most respected ""brand"" but as we all know it will not be the last. 

There will be superior blockchains to BTC, which is why studying business implications of #blockchain are paramount.

Certainly not r/bitcoin, which is known for very heavy moderation to the point of censorship. Other communities are better, but it isn't the same as it used to be. It's a shame, because a lot of people used to stumble into crypto communities while on Reddit.
