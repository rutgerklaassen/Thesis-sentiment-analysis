Every bitcoin sell off consolidates bitcoin ownership into stronger hands, reduces liquidity, and preps the next bull cycle. Ethereum is the better one to invest in. Either way this is a great time to buy, it will go back up. HODL!

How about this, we some how convinced people that ""hold"" bitcoin that a $3,000 price tag is ""bearish"", while a year ago, the same price level was considered outrageously bullish. Time skews perspective and advantages the bold, it is why value has a habit of flowing to the few.

There will be superior blockchains to BTC, which is why studying business implications of #blockchain are paramount.
