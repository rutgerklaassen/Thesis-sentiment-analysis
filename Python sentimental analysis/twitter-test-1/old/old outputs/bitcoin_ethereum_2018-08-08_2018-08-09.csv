Gamer bro here! Currently MMOs are a walled garden where assets the player acquires don't actually belong to them.  Players spend 100s of hours and $$$ on games and don't actually own anything.  This is the primary reason that

Why do you give Bitcoin so much attention when you don’t believe in it?? Let it go and stick to what you know.

Odds of a cryptocurrency winning: <100%.  Odds of it being something other than Bitcoin: 0%. Diversify out of cryptocurrencies, not by piling shit with Bitcoin.

Why is it a dilemma?  Bitcoin should never be opened up to the general public.  It's nothing more than a pyramid scheme.  The SEC is doing the right thing.  This market crash is just the whales taking a fit, probably trying to get the masses to gang up on the SEC.

While long-term ASIC resistance is futile the #ethereum PoW algorithm ( Ethash) holds up pretty well as it's intentionally designed to make memory bandwidth the bottleneck. https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash…
