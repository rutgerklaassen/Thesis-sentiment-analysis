Imagine Intel or Samsung producing chips for Bitcoin mining. Will they try to corner the mining industry or will they sell their chips to anyone and everyone?

Greg took time to read and comment on a paper I wrote on a Bitcoin mixing algo. I was a noob at the time, 2013ish. His acknowledgement was very encouraging.

You can't just preach to the Bitcoin choir.  The audience response was strong to our announcement of TxTenna today at Consensus 2018. People are eager for sincere decentralization efforts.

That bug was fixed within a week, and was never a consensus issue. It's pointless to bring it up now. How many bugs were there in the early life of Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency?
