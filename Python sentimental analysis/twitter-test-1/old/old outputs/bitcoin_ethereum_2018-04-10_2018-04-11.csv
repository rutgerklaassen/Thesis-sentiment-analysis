On this day (April 10th) in 2013 #Bitcoin plunged from $265 to $150 after reports of DDOS attacks on Mt. Gox and @Bitstamp.

Mt. Gox said it had suffered ‚Äúits worst trading lag ever.‚Äù 

Later, was hacked for 850,000 #BTC.

This is a reminder as to why secure DEXs are the future.",,,,,"['https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1013838427790270464/8QNIOEwb_mini.jpg', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DadSHQ7UQAAkyLG?format=jpg&name=small']",https://twitter.com/TheCoinDad/status/983846777559375873
