Kevin, the only way to possibly challenge Bitcoin is to ""Centralize, then Decentralize"", to be a lot more nimbler and work faster. There is no other way to ever compete with Bitcoin's 8-year lead. This is perfectly rational behavior.

How will you validate your own #bitcoin transactions when they're irreversibly hashed into your custodial #LightningNetwork superhub's settlement tx?

XRP, take a look around at the community and what's actually getting mainstream adoption. Last thing you want to do is integrate a coin that's going to disappear in the near future. And despite what other say XRP is a crypto asset.

I've always been of the opinion that what makes more sense is to focus on users not your *competition*. I'd type again that, given that Bitcoin and Ethereum have separate missions, they're not even competitors. Monero, for instance, is a Bitcoin competitor.

It was not overwhelming. Thousands (millions?) of users left for Ethereum and other coins because they found the Core policies intolerable. The remaining forked off with Bitcoin Cash.

alex I know you prefer BCash to Bitcoin, but when it comes to these concepts there is no difference between them. Miners don't validate, nodes do. I am guessing you don't really understand Bitcoin and frankly don't understand Bitcoin Cash.

Chris I think you're unfairly shooting the messenger (core devs). Remember, the users overwhelmingly chose to continue running Bitcoin core software and HODLing the coins from that chain.

I already see some serious red flags as for honesty:
- that cap was not put there by ""Greg"", but by Satoshi (who planned to increase it eventually)
- Bitcoin is not dead (or destroyed) by any meaningful metric.
Start getting these 2 facts stright & we can maybe arrive somewhere.
