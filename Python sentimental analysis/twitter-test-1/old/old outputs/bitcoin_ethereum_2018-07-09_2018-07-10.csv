I also know there's pain from a business sense. I'm also involved in Exodus Wallet, and we hurt every time the chain congests. As does Shapeshift and every other venture that relies on Bitcoin. So I understand there are some real practicalities that could have been done better.

BU/BitcoinABC are interchangeable here.

He threw his weight behind r/BTC, spreading propaganda & lies long before the BCH fork.

He wanted more power & control. It's always been about his ego and thirst for relevance.
