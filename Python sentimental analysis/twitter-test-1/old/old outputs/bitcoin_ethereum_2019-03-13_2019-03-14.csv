#Bitcoin costs are socialized amongst token holders through #BTC inflation paid to miners for processing transactions. Currently, this makes Bitcoin the most expensive option at over 10 USD/tx.

Through integration, #EOS can make Bitcoin scalable, cheap, and programmable.

On #2 - I think this position is misconstrued. Most ""maximalists"" (definition varies wildly even from the self-proclaimed) have no problem with competing currencies, they simply think the *results* of competition will be a schelling point for the strongest one (i.e. #Bitcoin)
