If Bitcoin follow Nasdaq. Bitcoin moves 10x the speed of Nasdaq so 1 year in Bitcoin is 10 Year in Nasaq. This means we hit our previous ATH at end of December 2019 and we break the ATH in February 2020.

at least you will stop saying that Bitcoin cash is the real Bitcoin. Now you must keep saying that Bitcoin ABC is the real Bitcoin cash... But still nobody cares about it anymore , you are just wasting time and money on it like Craig wastes it on his BSV chain.

Coinbase know that Bitcoin Core (BTC) holds little potential in ever gaining non-speculative use-demand, because its main chain can't scale past 3 transactions per second, and its limited script evaluation protocol doesn't allow secure sidechains.

sure, without them there is no Bitcoin. But I still believe speculators/traders/investors set the price at the margin to a greater extent than miners do. Without investors and hodlers, there is no profits for the mining industry.
