The fact that the bitcoin network has absorbed ~$68M globally by individuals opting in, without a promise of value, without a government/armed forces demonstrating it as legitimate, while running for 10 years with 99.98% uptime, is a rather significant signal of adoption.

Mainstream adoption was never the goal of Bitcoin. Read the whitepaper again, the network was established to remove trusted third parties from money creation and settlement. The goal is not to get everyone buying starbucks with bitcoin, the goal is sound uncensorable money.
