Regardless of who it is, having 90% bitcoin means nothing. Scammers pump alts for more bitcoin.

Looking through the predictable #Bitcoin maximalist responses to this tweet lets me focus the development of my own thesis counter to their ideology.
Not interested in debating or refuting an ideology (yet), just building out the rational, observable opposing case.

No, it's sitting in a few Ethereum accounts you can track via http://etherscan.io. We have some cold BAT with Coinbase, some for the Earn stuff, and we are about to put more cold BAT with BitGo custody. The rest you can trace. We are not trading it! Yeesh.
etherscan.io

I was also informally asked about Ethereum by people at Index Ventures around 2015. They were dismissive of it as vapourware, which surprised me considering the pace of Ethereum development activity on GitHub. I think they took their advice from Bitcoin maximalists.

Easy to forget now, but the Ethereum raise was the largest crowd fund in history of crowd funding. Hardly undersubscribed.

OR, I could just be pointing out obvious flaws in Bitcoin and you're the one projecting your own issues?  Maybe?  I mean really, you're layering on tons of presuppositions that are all of your imaginings

I realize that in the world of conventional politics, this is just how things are done. And you better know how to play the game. I hope Bitcoin is different in this regard...and that it takes a different kind of game to win it.

In the horribly paraphrased words of Mises, ""consumers are the judge, jury and executioners, and entrepreneurs/businesses are at their mercy."" Bitcoin gives each individual ""consumer"" the same authority as the BIS. When you're out of consensus with the market, you get rekt.

I certainly don‚Äôt take it personal. I lead a project focused on letting people spend Bitcoin. Period. It wasn‚Äôt an attack on Bitcoin to defend usability and reasonable fees. That‚Äôs not personal either.
