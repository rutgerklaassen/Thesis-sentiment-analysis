Lying is the last resort since they're out of valid arguments against Bitcoin Cash.

I suggest users simply use both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin (BTC) and compare which one performs true to Bitcoin's purpose as p2p electronic cash.

I’ve heard much propaganda before. The facts still are that with Lightning, you create a layer on top of Bitcoin, which in the end doesn’t really need to settle any longer. Also, “a fee market”(Greg Maxwell balloney), will never compare to billions of onchain transactions per day

I’m glad you asked. It’s in the basic design of Bitcoin: Miners compete to process transactions for the lowest amount of money. Those miners who charge the least, process more transactions. Very simple and ingenious.

Ethereum is solving the same problem. I don't know why it's so hard for some to wrap their head around this. Just because it has a VM doesn't suddenly change this. It simply makes it more flexible/progr. Dec., censorship-resistant, p2p, trust-min, self-sov value transfer.

It is an erc20 with an additional transfer and call token standard erc 677.  

To my knowledge there has been no communication regarding changing to another blockchain.

The ultimate settlement layer of #chainlink is #ethereum on purpose as we need unstoppable/immutable ledger.
