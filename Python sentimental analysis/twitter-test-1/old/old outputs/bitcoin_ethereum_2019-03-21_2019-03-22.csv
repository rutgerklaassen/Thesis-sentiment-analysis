REMINDER #1: You can slow Bitcoin adoption by keeping the 1MB block size cap in place.

REMINDER #2: You can kill Bitcoin adoption by hiring a bunch of core devs and have them build a side-chain.

REMINDER #3: You can make 99% of the users think Bitcoin is broken and needs LN.

Your math is wrong.

1GB will crush VISA.

In 5 years, 1GB blocks will seem absurdly small.

Technology does not get stuck in 2009... it keeps moving forward.

Bitcoin will have 1TB blocks in our lifetime.

To my knowledge, no state dept of labor has opined on paying wages in cryptocurrency.  I think it would be a hard sell, but maybe you could convince them it's ok to pay in Bitcoin with employee consent. Paying in some altcoin the company itself is selling? Never gonna happen.

True Bitcoiners see Bitcoin from high above. Craig sees it better than anyone... A birds eye view like a true generalist. We need people that can see/understand the whole system. Devs can be great coders, but too often they can't see the forest, because the're down in the trees.

It all depends what you're taking a cross section *of*. I believe that most (for some very vague notion of most) members of the Bitcoin community would identify as actual supporters of ""Szabo's Law"". I think that most Ethereum community members would not. I think that matters.
