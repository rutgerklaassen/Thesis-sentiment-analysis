Stability?  I received XRP cross border in 3 seconds and was straight into fiat. That’s stable. I lost nothing. Bitcoin over hours I lost 2% during the 6 hours. That’s not stable.

Tether traded in 2015. #Bitcoin was already thriving before and will survive even if Tether fully collapses. Might get ugly and delay things a few years, but won't change key strengths. It's a risk, but not a fatal vulnerability. In fact, surviving that would further Lindy #BTC

That’s Ripples use case and mine is fast XRP to Fiat cross border transactions. I use XRP as currency as it takes 3 seconds. With XRP I lost nothing over 3 seconds. With Bitcoin over 6 hours I lost 2%, that’s “dumb money”.

You are mistaken. The only reason A seeming majority went to the new Ethereum was because the EF possesses the ETH trademark including the prism and ticker symbol, as such all exchanges and mining pools followed the ‘ETH-F’ chain and left ETC for dead. Only 5.5% voter turnout!

When you use wasabi you pay two fees. 

One to miners - the normal bitcoin transaction fee - wasabi attempts to use the lowest fee possible depending on tx activity.

And one to wasabi developers, that fee structure is in the tweet above.
