1) Ripple is a company which is taking advantage of a public digital asset called XRP, which also can‚Äòt be sued
2) Every legal entity can be sued, like Blockstream, Coinbase, Bitgo, Ethereum foundation etc - so what‚Äòs the news?

You can sue Bitcoin Core devs, miners, exchanges, & custodial wallets. It'd be delusional to say BTC volume & price would not drop significantly once you've targeted these categories. Albeit ""Bitcoin"" is much harder to sue than Ripple given # of parties & responsibility diffusion

Nick has a point.

If (devils advocate) Ripple Labs were dismantled for whatever reason, XRP would suffer tremendously (lack of ongoing development, partner validators dropping offline, loss of mkt confidence etc.)

Bitcoin does not have this attack vector.

One can‚Äôt rationally borrow in a hyper-deflationary currency.  If it‚Äôs all Bitcoin, there are no mortgages and no car loans.  Even with a negative interest rate, future deflation is hard to gauge and extremely risky over 30 years.

Thankfully, Bitcoin is going to do away with the types who sit back and say, ""That's how it works"", rather than saying, ""It is a disgrace and should be stopped"". Bitcoin does all that hard work for the ethical. Equivocators are not needed to support it. It will do its job.
