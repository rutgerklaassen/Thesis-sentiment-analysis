Broke: Malicious behavior occurs, with no deterrent.

Joke: No need to deter, because deterred malicious behavior rarely occurs.

Woke: A strong deterrent effect alleviates the need to exercise the deterrent.

Agreed. Every social movement has its extremists (who wouldn't change their ""faith"" even in the face of better tech), and I'm sure Bitcoin has its share. But I suspect the alarmists are severely exaggerating the problem.

Ethereum has a much larger market saturation and access to capital.

BitShares is no where near as well known as Ethereum, but that will change over time.

Of note, BitShares already handles more transactions per day than Ethereum. Check out http://blocktivity.info for more info.
