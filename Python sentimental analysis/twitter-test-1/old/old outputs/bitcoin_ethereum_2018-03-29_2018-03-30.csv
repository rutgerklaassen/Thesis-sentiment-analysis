There is NO WAY that Lightning Network can serve the unbanked with centralized custodial hubs.   Bitcoin Cash is true spirit of Bitcoin and I will never sell my BCH, only spend it.

Change the beginning to: the NSA stole Bitcoin from Satoshi Nakamoto, killed him/her, planted a stand-in to assume the identity of Nakamoto and hide in the woods and it works.

I hope for your poor clients' sake you mean Treasuries or something and not Tesla bonds??!! 
How's the Gerber crypto-bubble index doing YTD? You were sending zillions of crypto hyping tweets when bitcoin was at 20k. Surely you should be banging the table hard at 7K? !

It doesn't make sense to do any of that . It's more profitable for ASIC manufacturers to mine with what they build. They sell people last year's tech while they use the current tech. Rinse and repeat.
