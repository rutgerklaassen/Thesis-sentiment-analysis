Onslaught?
I know bitcoin guys like changing definitions of words like ""fast"" and ""store""....but no likes and 1 comment isn't an onslaught.
(Trying to send $100 with a single Lightning Network transaction makes the network feel like its an onslaught)

That's completely the opposite of reality. In fact Bitcoin cannot evolve, it can only create forks. Xrp however has an amendment strategy that prevents forking during its evolution

Ah, I think you misunderstood (or we communicated poorly).  HWI[1] is a Bitcoin Core sub-project that provides scripts you can use to bridge hardware wallets to Bitcoin Core.  There aren't currently distributed with the regular binaries.

Why it took you so many months to tell your followers that you bought all your Bitcoin in the $3000s and Litecoin sub $30? Whats the point of telling this now when most of them missed that golden chance?

I have had it disabled by default so that folks didn’t get confused and send to Bitcoin Core wallet when they meant to send to LND wallet. But! Now that it’s using bitcoind instead of bitcoin-qt, the risk of confusion is gone and I’ll enable the wallet by default
