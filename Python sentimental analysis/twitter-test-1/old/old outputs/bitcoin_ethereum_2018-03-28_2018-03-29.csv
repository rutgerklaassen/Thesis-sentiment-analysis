I made a blockchain with smart contracts inside the lightning network.
No VC funding,  no ico, no employer.

I'm also an AMD shill, paid by Intel, Ethereum hater, Monero dev, and much more. My next story is critical to Cisco, so tomorrow I'll probably be a Huawei employee for a day.

You should spend the time looking at the Bitcoin Cash community with open eyes.  All the best system builders are working on it.  A good software developer does not equal a good system builder and its a really important distinction for this space.

I find this argument very uncompelling. Value is not derived by who is working on something or all the ways that thing could potentially be used by someone, but instead by who is actually willing to buy it and how much they buy.

Bitcoin remains king in that regard.

 The LN network is NOT a peer to peer cash system anymore than your bank account is. It is a redundant trust minimized bank transfer system for unregistered banks. It is also a POS takeover attempt of POW bitcoin. Shifting fees to large staking txn hubs.

Security tokens are going to be the only thing standing after Bitcoin. Will take long time to play out but that‚Äôs my best guess :)

I would also say which businesses (aside from VC firms) are still supporting Bitcoin?  The list is growing daily for BCH.  Carefully read the words of Brian Armstrong and Tony Gallippi and other business leaders in this space.  They have all diplomatically abandoned BTC for BCH.
