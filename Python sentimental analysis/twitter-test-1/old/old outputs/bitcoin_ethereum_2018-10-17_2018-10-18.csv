The EF has been doing cease and desist actions on obviously scammy uses of ""Ethereum"" for years.

But Vitalik made a hard call on not enforcing vs Ethereum Classic alone right away, despite lots of howling to enforce.

The EF could easily have done so.  He chose not to.

Nice chart - however the opening sentence makes a bizzare claim: ""Bitcoin & similar cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have been on fire for the better part of 2018"". #Bitcoin & #ethereum market value have collapsed in 2018. Maybe @siamohajer1 can define ""on fire""? #Incinerated?

It's a valid perspective, but I'm not sure you can separate the two battles. Could be that all coins that can't beat Bitcoin cannibalize each other, leaving speculators to prefer newness and high risk/reward.

Cash-settled futures can impact price of underlyings & in some mkts synthetics can be tail that wags dog (eg, CDS drove corp bonds not vice versa pre-crisis). But for #bitcoin they’re not as dangerous as physical derivs, which can create artificial supply & illusion of liquidity
