BTC in 2016 prior to second halving was around $450 and less than 2 years later we are at $9000. 20X. 
Next halving will be in 2020 so by 2022 a $200k BTC seems reasonable.

May 11, 2018","#Bitcoin's future price is more predictable than you might think for these reasons. 1. The supply of BTC is programmed and not subject to the whims of government. 2. There is a large growing #HODL contingent 3. There is now a clear longterm trend line 4. Volatility is slowing.

He wanted to radical experimental things rapidly.  And, you see, bitcoin doesn't do radical, experimental, or rapid, because way too much money is at stake and that would be irresponsible.  In the future, this kind of experimentation can, should, and will happen on sidechains.
