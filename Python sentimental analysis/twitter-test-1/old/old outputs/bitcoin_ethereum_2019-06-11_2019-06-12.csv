Because of the Bitcoin symbol in his twitter handle. Lmao jk, he‚Äôs going based on circulating supply. Same as when Bitcoin was $3. That is quite a high number but remember XRP is actually deflationary and he‚Äôs going based on aggregate supply not circulating supply.

I'm a value guy and I don't see any real value in bitcoin. It's entirely sentiment driven and as long as there is another sucker buying it at a higher price the party continues. Till we are out of suckers.

WTF? It's on the blockchain

""He could provide the public addresses for the first 70 blocks -- and provided those addresses, but also explaining that he did not have public addresses for bitcoin that was mined after those blocks because that information is held in a blind trust.""

Nothing but facts from space cats with no  personal agenda, right? Name one thing that has been developed on/for Bitcoin SV in the last two months. If you can't, or straight up won't (theres plenty), then I'll take it for face value.

This seems to be a repeating pattern for projects you back over the past several months. I wonder, if your due diligence is up to PAR&  where it needs to be? Or Do you say yes to anyone willing to pay & DYOR afterwards? Take it seriously. Don't take things to market until U 100%.

Yes, you can do it today. It‚Äôs clunky but 100% possible. You‚Äôd incorporate as a smart contract, on the Ethereum chain or one of the newer ones. It would mirror Delaware concepts. You‚Äôd receive payments on-chain and pay your employees in the same way (perhaps via stablecoin).
