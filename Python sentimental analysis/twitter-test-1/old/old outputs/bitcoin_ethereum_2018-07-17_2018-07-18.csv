There will be at most 21 million bitcoins in existence. There isn't even enough BTC to go around for EVERY millionaire to own one. So before you buy any other coin (LTC included), try to own at least 1 BTC first. 

Once you have 1 BTC, buy all the shitcoins you want!

- A bitcoin ETF *could* be approved on August 10th
- Coinbase *may* list up to 5 assets & *may* have Finra approval (

- BlackRock *might* be eyeing crypto

I'm already hearing a lot of noise about higher highs for $BTC

I'm bullish long term on $BTC and even short term for alt trades

But I want to remind you about what happens when the majority gets extremely bullish during this crypto market downtrend

Take it one day at a time

Problem is: this is exactly what they promised their investors: a shitty user experience requiring purchase/use their ERC20. Either mastery of impossibly complex ethereum node or use of third parties. That's the only upside they'd ever get from no-rights no-equity utility tokens.

This is undoubtedly why yours is focusing more on the money button. Building a social media site is no small task, and focus on bch at the company limits the site.

Both Bitcoin communities are overly focused on their own echo chambers, which leads to boring or toxic social media

So I'm supposed to have a trading bot on bittrex, or shapeshift, or manually manage a new forex pair, then trade/pay exchange fees, then receive bitcoins? I should also run ethereum node or pay $ETH processor or 3rd party, run a new wallet? And now i have to care about Ethereum?
