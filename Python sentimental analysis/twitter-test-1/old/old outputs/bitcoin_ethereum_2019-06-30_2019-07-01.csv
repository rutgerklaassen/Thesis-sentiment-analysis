Some unexpected #Bitcoin upside surprises: 

1) Wealth inside BTC community creates huge political leverage to change, write laws. 

2) A sovereign breaks ranks and adds BTC as strategic reserve. 

3) Confidence is any/all fiat collapses.

#BitcoinCash is a fork of Bitcoin.  The community split in 2017 after years of debating how to accommodate more users.  The best way to learn is to try both and experience them directly.  Buy a little bit of each and send it to your own wallet where you own the secret key.

Yes it's true that debt today has a massive advantage thanks to inflation. But imagine a world post-hyperbitcoinization, surely there'd still be some business investments that earn a bitcoin return and could pay back with interest.

debt will tend to introduce credit cycles rather than business cycles. I think credit is a function of paper claims in the legacy system we live with. Interest will not be native to a bitcoin financial system.

There is a built implied return of holding bitcoin. What rate might be accepted over that implied rate to justify the risk. Today we have tossed risk into the garbage can. Often lenders are really more like equity. most would want equity a real cut of the action.
