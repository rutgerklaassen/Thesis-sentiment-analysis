Not true. Is there only one currency right now? Is there only one store of value right now? As long as there are many people on the earth, there will be many choices of all of those.

Tezos sells to Bitfinex.
 You can trade with Bitcoin or buy it with USD. 

Tim Draper said. 

""We think tezos is going to be one of the greatest tokens of our time"". 

A wonderful future to you.

It's not a mistake, he just can't admit he's addicted to looking at his bitcoin in fiat terms. Lots of early adopters like this. Like any addict they come up with a million excuses. If he or Brian actually used Bitcoin instead of thinking about using bitcoin, they would see this.

Central banks and govt intervention are why bitcoin is necessary. Isolated bank failures is not the same thing as system wide ruin.

Instead of setting up a new Bitcoin node I created a VPN and joined a second RPI. The second RPI now only needs to run C-Lightning on a remote connection to the RaspiBlitz's Bitcoin node (without exposing the RPC ports to the Wild Wild Web.
