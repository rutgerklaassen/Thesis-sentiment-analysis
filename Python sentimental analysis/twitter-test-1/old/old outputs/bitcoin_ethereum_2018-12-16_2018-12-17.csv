Part of monetary sovereignty is principle of allodium. Bitcoin is an equity-based asset; no-one's liability. But still subject to exchange-rate risk. With debt can be margin called.

When there were only 11 bitcoin nodes, a deep re-org due to network partition was a real worry. Now the bigger worry should be a surprise deep re-org. Refusing to do an 11-deep re-org is reasonable and has nothing to do with centralization.

Dec 17, 2018","So at $18k, Bitcoin's ""market cap"" a year ago was $305 billion, today it's around $57 billion, a drop of almost $250 billion.

Even counting some spinoffs, GE's market cap has dropped over $400B (but they paid a dividend!). 

Just some rough perspective.

The greatest wealth is created by being an early investor in #Innovation

Making that investment requires believing in something before the majority of people understand it

You will be mocked, ridiculed & criticized for your non-consensus action

It is absolutely worth it!

Both completely failed to store value in the crypto bear market. But Ethereum has a plethora of use cases beyond just “digital gold” and “digital store of value”, and Bitcoin doesn’t.

People want to earn bitcoin more than they want to spend it right now. Our merchants want to attract customers with low risk and little-to-no friction. Lolli serves both sides current needs.

No that was Borgstream Core's fault. They planted saboteurs in the Bitcoin Cash community and ruined everything.

Not worth the stress involved in holding high interest debt, but would be a lot less risky than investing in #ethereum or #xrp

I think Bitcoin will succeed, just not at achieving the maximalist vision. It will be a digital gold amongst many other crypto assets. Hyperbitcoinization assumes a religious conviction that even maximalists only really pretend to have in order to increase their personal wealth.
