I am one of the few developers who worked on node implementations for both Bitcoin *and* Ethereum. When I worked on Ethereum, I was always thinking if it were successful it would probably address a fundamentally different set of problems because of different tradeoff choices.

It never really competed with Bitcoin over developers. Ethereum just did a lot more fundraising and events to promote this. But I believe Bitcoin's incentive structures are *WAY* more robust and durable.

... Either they were just interested in the space and didn't come up with something to build until ETH had a different pitch for utility of some types of systems (the merits of which is a different debate) or they got in after. Those who were building for Bitcoin's vision didn't.
