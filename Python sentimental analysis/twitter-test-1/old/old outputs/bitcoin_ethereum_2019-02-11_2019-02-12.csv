2/ Problem 2: ok, but now we want to do more sophisticated transactions with business logic, e.g. a bond that pays out on a set schedule. Answer: decentralized consensus model where the people verify the business logic is followed correctly -> ethereum

No no no, you're all wrong. The block weight should not be reduced to an arbitrary number, but rather it should adjust dynamically to target $100 transaction fees to pay for thermodynamic security and force spammy use cases onto Lightning Network. Fee market or bust!

It's crazy to me that this is even being seriously discussed by anyone but Luke-Jr (and BCH/BSV proponents that would love to see a fracture in the Bitcoin community) given that we barely just crawled out of the trenches of the block size war.

I don't think its nonsensical 

Most people I know don't even have $6k laying around to invest in 1 whole bitcoin - let alone $10k+

I understand your perspective 

I'm just speculating that Bitcoin will be beyond $10k in the next 3 years 

Because technically the correction started end of 2017 and that would give the market close to 4 years to somewhat recover and put it a price where most ppl can't buy one

2/ To be compatible with legacy pre-segwit bitcoin, SW block weight maps directly and elegantly onto the legacy 1M block size limit.  Pointing out current software lacks 1M check is nitpicking & misleading, because binary compatibility with legacy 1M limit remains preserved.
