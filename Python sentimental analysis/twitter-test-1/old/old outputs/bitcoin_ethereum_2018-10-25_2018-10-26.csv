Sure! Constantinople is the next Ethereum hard fork that will be early 2019. In it, block rewards are cut 33%. 

Shasper is the next major Ethereum upgrade introducing Sharding and proof of stake

I just did a podcast that explains it all if you‚Äôd like

As Bitcoin matures,
(1) each subsequent blow off top area will be less volatile
(2) Coin volume exchanged not as high as past cycles
(3) Cycles are elongating
All of these are perfectly rational and to be expected as B matures, (especially in next 2 cycles prehyperbitcoinization)

No, I am not asking for donations. While I do accept donations, the purpose of the Patreon page is to establish funding for my work. Patreon is not GoFundMe.

And as I think I made clear upfront, the only reason it is in USD is because there is nothing comparable using Bitcoin.
