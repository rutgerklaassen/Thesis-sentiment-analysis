Core devs are not opposed to capacity increases (ie segwit IS a capacity increase). They have decided to exhaust all options for non bandwidth increase based scaling BEFORE simply raising the block size. This will happen via consensus. https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html‚Ä¶

Making this about ""Censorship"" or ""Free Speech"" is cowardice. You're just moving the goalposts and re-framing the entire issue for your own purposes. It's about DECEPTION and dishonesty. Change the account to ""Bitcoin Cash"" and @ BCASH or something and it be a non-issue.

I think CSW understands (or at least his actions indicate an understanding) of things about the social/psychological aspect of Bitcoin that many of us in BCH and BTC don't demonstrate that we understand very well.

Bitcoin is primarily a social experiment, not a technical one.
