You said people don't want to spend bitcoin because it ""has value"". Then you say just switch to bitcoin for something people have to spend. A contradiction.

The idea that we must up front pick and foist the one true future global currency - or is it digital gold? - is nonsense.

Look it’s simple. SegWit could’ve been activated by now even with minority hashpower, as long as there’s clear support in the community, with no added risk of any kind of split (ie no more risk than the risk that miners could proactively split bitcoin right now if they wanted to)

 to prove that a screenshot wasn't faked. You get both a pretty reliable host for the data, and a timestamp to prove when the data was uploaded. Twitter is now immutable.

No. The Bitcoin is created by an algorithm, just like XRP. Both have a hard limit of the number of coins that exists. With BTC they reward miners with BTC as a means of distribution of coins.

Thanks for the shoutout! FWIW, I don’t see any particular reason for Brave to adopt Bitcoin for now.

If the idea of consumers paying publishers to block ads has any legs, then the most critical element is getting adoption fast. This means USD, not BTC (and definitely not BAT)
