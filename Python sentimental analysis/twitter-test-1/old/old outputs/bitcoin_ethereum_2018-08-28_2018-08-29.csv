You don't get it do you?

They do everything to keep Bitcoin from scaling up naturally.

10 years overtime is not exactly rushing.

blocks ARE small because the limit IS small, businesses cannot build on it, users stay away.

How often do you stress about Bitcoin distribution? Every day, around 2000 new $BTC are distributed to miners who sell it at exchanges for whatever price they need to cover the electricity cost. Large airdrops are over, for past 6 months Byteball has airdropped to actual users.

Yep, plenty of #bitcoin for everyone--exactly. But there's no limit to how many bitcoin-substitutes #WallSt can create. And thru rehypothecation, it's standard practice on #WallSt to create more claims to an asset than there are assets. Articles here: https://forbes.com/search/?q=caitlin%20long#77ad68f3279f‚Ä¶

of course! I didn't write this quote & it's out of context. The context is that #WallSt creates bitcoin-substitutes in a quantity that exceeds the actual #bitcoin. That's standard practice on Wall St, and it's called rehypothecation.
