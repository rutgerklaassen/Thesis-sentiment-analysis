I‚Äôm guilty of using a secondary axis at times, but to show a relationship between the two data series. 

I‚Äôm more upset that this data is meaningless. There‚Äôs a bitcoin ATM in the Subway down the street. They pay you $5,000 to put it in your store. Nobody uses it.

 I just read your post on integrating Ethereum Blockchain into your platform. Plus enabling ERC-20 tokens. This is great news for

When the BIS actually figures out what the properties of Bitcoin are, they will start accumulating with such ferocity that it'll make your head spin.

It's sad that my self-debates about Bitcoin are more interesting than debates I have on twitter with people who disagree with me on Bitcoin. I wish people understood their own arguments to make them better than I can Steelman them. Maybe one day!
