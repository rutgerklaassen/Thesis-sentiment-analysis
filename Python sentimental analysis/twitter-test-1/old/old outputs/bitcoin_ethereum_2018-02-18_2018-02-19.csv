Bitcoin is capital and currency in one thing. It is an accounting means, and an immaterial material; an intangible asset. The only true information as property. It is infinitely durable, and can generate wealth. It provides a service and a facility to business by storing records.

I think #cryptos are definitely here to stay but I don’t think they will at their current form (it’s the napster of this generation). Furthermore, I don’t think #bitcoin will prevail a) beacause its not the most technologically advanced vs other cryptos b) forks beat its purpose

I don't. Ceteris paribus, I would prefer Bitcoin instant, 0 fee, completely anonimous and super-secure. But reality is a bitch: right now the only way to have Bitcoin instant, 0 fee and a little more fungibile is Lightning Network, which is slightly less secure than onchain.

It's not a matter of ""disagreeing"": you should just study LN & Bitcoin better. It cannot centralize current (trusted) offchain model, only decentralize it: a lot in best case, a little in worst case. It's not ""credit"", also. And blockchain scalability problems weren't ""created"".

I think it is misleading to say that it is ""determined"" by miners. It is not really a blank slate for them to write on. A nuke-enabled USSR might ""determine"" the survival of American residents, but only in a a naive sense.
