Hi @Jeff_Daniels . My name is Jason. I work near The Purple Rose theater in Chelsea Mi. I am wondering if you would consider accepting Litecoin for admission along with your other payment options. My phone has become my wallet. BTW Dumb and Dumber is still one of my favs.

Bears, you are in ICU & trying to survive. Technically your last chance is to hold 200 SMA on daily at 10,000
