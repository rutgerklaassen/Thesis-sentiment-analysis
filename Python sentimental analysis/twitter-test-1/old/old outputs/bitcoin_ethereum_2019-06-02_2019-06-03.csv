Last bull market, bitcoin beat everyone's expectations:

$8000 - $10000: 11 days
$10000 - $12000: 7 days
$12000 - $14000: 1 day
$14000 - $16000: 1 day
$16000 - $18000: 8 days 

Now consider the fundamentals today vs 2017. 

I've never been more bullish.

From the EIP:

""To give a concrete example, it currently costs 820,000 gas to validate the cryptography in a typical AZTEC confidential transaction. If the gas schedule for the precompiles correctly reflected their load on the Ethereum network, this cost would be 197,000 gas.""

Some companies do pay developers to work on Bitcoin.

Although not all - we'd probably be in a better place if each company had at least one full time dev. Not only because we'd have more development work getting done, but also the businesses would be able to tap them in a crisis
