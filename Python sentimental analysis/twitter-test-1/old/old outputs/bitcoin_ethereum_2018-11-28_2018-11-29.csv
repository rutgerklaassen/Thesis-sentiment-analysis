1. If you believe in Bitcoin long term, accumulate it (buy it)

2. Don’t spend more than you can afford lose (control emotion)

""We define Circulating Supply as the best approximation of the number of coins that are circulating in the market and in the general public's hands.""

With #Bitcoin you do not even try to approximate that. Instead you take all created ones as the basis for the calculation.

As a side note, this is a good example of why I like to point out that Bitcoin isn't p2p. You don't actually send coins, you reassign the right to move them in a public database. What gov wants to is disallow db updates from specific keyholders.

Consensus is the longest chain. Not a 10 block defence. And not a centralised secret decision between a cabal of exchanges.

You are literally trusting your Dev team to make hidden, secret emergency deals when feeling theatened.

That's not very open source.

The holders of the $BTC in those addresses effectively pay transaction fees to whomever mined that #BItcoin block.
