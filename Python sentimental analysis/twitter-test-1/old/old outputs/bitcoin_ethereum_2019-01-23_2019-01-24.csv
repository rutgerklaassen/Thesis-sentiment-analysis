VanEck ETF was always nocoiner accumulation scam from beginning to buy up cheap $BTC from weak hands after each announcement of delay and now withdraw. Except most noobs to #Bitcoin have been educated and are wise to Wall Street’s scammy ways.

Danske Bank requires a 2000kr. About 250 euro fee per transaction that has been in contact with Bitcoin if they even allow it, often they just block it. The reason behind it is overhead related to ensure KYC/AML. They are an old institution that has to die.
