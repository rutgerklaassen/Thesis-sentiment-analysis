No, I certainly don‚Äôt, but I believe in precious metals much more than I do Bitcoin. There‚Äôs nothing special about Bitcoin - millions of other cryptocurrencies can compete with it. There are no barriers to entry. Plus, way too much speculation in it.

Reminds me when BTC crashed Christmas Day 2017.  

I missed all by NBA bets and waited over 42 hours for confirmation.  

99 reasons ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù is trash... that is just ONE.  

PoW is a failed experiment turned fad turned scam.

''The fact that more economists aren't interested in this stuff is flabbergasting to me.'' So true. This is data driven analysis that is helping to build rational perspectives and much better price discovery for Bitcoin and other networks. Massive tip of the hat

Bitcoin has a fixed supply, but you keep moving your supply zones after every move.

Absolutely CLUELESS.

This is not true. PoS mining takes the same effort/work as Bitcoin mining, minus the PoW (wasteful nonce guessing). This means PoS mining expenses are lower, which is precisely why PoS coins can/will have lower inflation than PoW coins. 

Taxation is the same as in PoW mining.

All it has demonstrated is that it can easily be changed by a small group of fools. Do you think it can possibly resist when the state comes along and requires it to be changed? Only Bitcoin is immutable, which is its most valuable trait BY FAR.

I‚Äôm aware of that, but those other cryptos will compete with Bitcoin for demand, cannibalizing it. As I said during the late-2017 crypto bubble, ‚Äúthe only cure for high prices is high prices.‚Äù
