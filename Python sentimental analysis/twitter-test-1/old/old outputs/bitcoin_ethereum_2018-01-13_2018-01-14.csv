All the advantages of #BitcoinCash are provided by #BitcoinPrivate plus $BTCP will have faster block times, privacy, better miner decentralization, fees that are just as low (if not lower), and a team that doesn't rely on shady marketing tactics. So, why should we use #BCash?

Hi Tom, you paid a fee of ""only"" $4.62. Unfortunately, this fee is far too low for the Bitcoin Core (BTC) network. You might wait up to two weeks until your transaction is dropped from network mempools. 

Next time, try using Bitcoin Cash. $4.62

Large exchanges and services (XAPO most likely), consolidating their UTXOs. This is a good thing.

Consolidating cannot be done on the Bitcoin Core chain because it would be too expensive.

I don't have answers to these questions but I feel a bit concerned when I see bitcoiners thinking that UASF, No2X or BCH hard fork were great ""victories"" for Bitcoin. IMHO, these events are first and foremost the symptoms of serious future problems.
