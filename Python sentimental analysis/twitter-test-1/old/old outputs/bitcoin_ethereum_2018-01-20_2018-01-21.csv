Fair call. I sold 20% of my bitcoin for ETH yesterday to hedge a bit and I‚Äôve been 90% in bitcoin since 2013. Thomas Lee 
@fundstrat
 reinforced my trade decision with his bullish views on ETH the other day.

It's an exchange platform for crypto exclusively. You must use Bitcoin or Ethereum as your base trading currency. You start by buying with Coinbase or similar exchanges that allow you to buy with a CC or bank transfer. Then you move your Bitcoin over to the exchange to trade.

Key: bitcoin *conference*

True crypto nerds don't go to conferences, they hang out in pubs or basements and do their ""conferencing"" on Telegram or Discord and make occasional trips to Hawaii to look at sea turtles. Or so I'm told.

You do realize fiat is backed by debt- crypto is backed by fiat- if u didnt care about fiat or banks- then unpair btc from fiat and then see what its true value is-  send fiat from bank- buy btc- hate bank/fiat- pair bitcoin to fiat- btc goes up- sell btc to fiat- withdraw 2 bank
