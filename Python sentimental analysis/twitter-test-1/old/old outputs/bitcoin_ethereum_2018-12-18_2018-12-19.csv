Bitcoin extortionists threaten victims with ‘hitman’ unless they cough up $4K

1\ Remember when #BTC tx fees were really high and everyone was worried about #dust in the chain?

Did it go away? How much dust IS there? Will #Bitcoin ever stop making dust? Should we even care?

Read our new article for answers (and speculation!).

It will barely be a debate and will end up with another crapcoin clone forking off.  You will never be able to collect enough consensus for this to be a reality on Bitcoin.  IMO it is one of its key value drivers.

If you have followed Coinbase you know that they haven't only 'provided options'. They have been pretty much anti Bitcoin after Brian went deep in ethereum. Also enabled bcash way more than was natural right after the fork.

Compared to the mktcap of Ethereum, funding this costs next to nothing. There has to be a better way than one-off grants. Obviously funding via inflation is the easiest and fairest, but may be tough to get consensus. Other option is community donations
