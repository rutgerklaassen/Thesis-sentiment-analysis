Getting close to a move in either direction.

That was great speech. Stop spreading lies about BTC just to make people believe BCH is Bitcoin. BTC is Bitcoin.

Untrue‚Äî there is more than 32m bitcoin including Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash, let alone the other forks. And if 51% of miners decide in the future to create more again then they can and will. Bitcoin isn‚Äôt this totally autonomous system it relies on coordination between humans

Bitcoin is a carriage. XRP is a race-car.

It's also worth comparing that to the value of new bitcoin that entered circulation in the same time period. 144 blocks a day at 12.5 BTC/block and $10k per BTC over 6 months (180 days) is over $3 billion.

Oh so if you fork Bitcoin and use ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù in its name it suddenly creates more BTC..? The market decides the value of each fork. And some are not worth much.. what does that have to do with the 21million BTC ?

I have bought one and have been using it .  I absolutely love the Bitfi hardware wallet.  It is the 2nd generation of hardware wallets.  It just need more coins to be added soon.  Hopefully bitcoin private and digibyte soon.  That is 200k combined community right there.

Register at the link above, buy the unit preloaded with Bitcoin. Get the Bitcoins and you get $100,000. Or. . . were you expecting to get $100,000 plus free Bitcoins and a free wallet? Sorry, but our business is limited to planet Earth and its norms.
