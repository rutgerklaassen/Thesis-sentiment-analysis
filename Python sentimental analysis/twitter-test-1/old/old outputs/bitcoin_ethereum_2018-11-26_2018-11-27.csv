Bitcoin enthusiasts: This is the currency of the future!

Sensible folk: Do you . . . .actually use this currency in transactions yourself?

Enthusiasts: Um . . . no. What's your point?

Funny anecdote. It is your scepticism that helped me understand #Bitcoin back in 2013, when I also though it was a ponzi. Thanks Peter and keep spreading the good news, you are unknowingly helping the movement everyday. Thanks for your work on #AustrianEconomics

Peter, if you believe Bitcoin is going to 0, short it and put up a website displaying how your short position is doing. 
Just because an asset price is falling doesn't mean it's fundamentals are flawed.

Game over? Really? How about you agree to retire if Bitcoin ever goes back over 10k? Of course you won't because you're all talk and will continue to be wrong.

The one that successfully mined 64mb block, that one is as sounds as crypto gets. Bitcoin SV the original and most powerful crypto ever.

There is no doubt, none, not 1 single doubt that POW Crypto is a good thing. Especially for exchanges that want to trade and be manipulated by a few individuals as demonstrated by the recent hash war over the Bitcoin cash fiasco.

Gold has been flat.  But I expect that to change.  Bitcoin's past resurrections are preventing the HODLers from realizing that this time it's really dead, and not coming back.  There will be more rallies, but not new highs.
