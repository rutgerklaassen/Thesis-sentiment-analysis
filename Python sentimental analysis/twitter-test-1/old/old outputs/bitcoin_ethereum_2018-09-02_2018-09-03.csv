So this proves that Bitcoin SV will NOT be an upgrade that could cause a fork. Nobody can manage to print a 32mb block yet. Let alone a 128mb one. The blocklimit is a GOAL to aim for. NOT A LIMIT TO CAP YOUR GROWTH. Undo the brainwashing by bitcoin core devs.

Well, you should have thought of that before you decided to go against Bitcoin and thus turned the entire Bitcoin community into your enemies.

As a highly technical user, I had to give up running a full validated history Ethereum node after the third time the block db was corrupted, necessitating a full re-sync from genesis. Never had any issue like that with my other nodes.

apparently satoshi was convinced by Hal Finney to put the 1MB artificial blocksize limit in place.

the reasons was fear for 'potential DoS attack' (Sending lots of data to a node may make it so busy it cannot process normal Bitcoin transactions)
