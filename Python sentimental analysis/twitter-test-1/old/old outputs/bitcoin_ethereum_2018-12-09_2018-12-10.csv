Original announcement was made back in April. We're making good on our promise, giving folks a fungible cryptocurrency.

SmartCash is striving to be global money, something that a privacy fungible coin can't hope to achieve. Bitcoin Confidential addresses a niche some care about.

Bitcoin‚Äôs trust-minimized design on the base-layer makes the network less centrally-political(smaller attack surface) & more representative of the network as a whole than traditional centrally-issued currencies/government systems. I think it‚Äôs as good as we can get in practice.

Depends on the institution's argument and attack surfaces. Bitcoin's in each regard is is much lower than any central bank fiat currency's or pseudo-cryptocurrencies like Petro.  Far from perfect though & would give rise to strong tests of Bitcoin governance & ideology.

That said, we should be aware of Bitcoin‚Äôs influencers, bridges and network dynamics. Key software development groups, miners, big asset owners, early adopters, etc...all bring some politics. Complex networks are resilient to many conventional attacks, but not everything.
