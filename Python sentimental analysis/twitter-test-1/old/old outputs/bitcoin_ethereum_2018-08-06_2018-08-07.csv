Why do you think they created Futures?

Why do you think they suppressed its adoption by artificial 1MB cap?

Of course not until Bitcoin becomes unit of acct it‚Äôs controled by whomever controls paper valuation of Bitcoin.

This is history repeating: Block Buster Video-->Netflix, Fax Machine-->Email, Land Line Phone-->Smart Phone, Desktop-->Laptop, Set Top Box-->Streaming. It never occurs to you, until it occurs. Gold as a store of value-->Bitcoin as a store of value.

The proof is elementary. Just look at the price chart of Bitcoin since the advent of bitcoin futures in mid-December 2017. The gold people tried to warn the HODLers, but were laughed at. This is exactly how precious metals have been suppressed for years.
