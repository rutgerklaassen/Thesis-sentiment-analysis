This is history repeating: Block Buster Video-->Netflix, Fax Machine-->Email, Land Line Phone-->Smart Phone, Desktop-->Laptop, Set Top Box-->Streaming. It never occurs to you, until it occurs. Gold as a store of value-->Bitcoin as a store of value.

The proof is elementary. Just look at the price chart of Bitcoin since the advent of bitcoin futures in mid-December 2017. The gold people tried to warn the HODLers, but were laughed at. This is exactly how precious metals have been suppressed for years.
