Why didn't you guys just take the time to set up your own wallet?  There are plenty of open source options you can just install and run without having to use any third party. Utilize the censorship resistance of Bitcoin which allows you to be your own bank, and not use coinbase.

The issue for bitcoin is that it is a solution in search of a problem. You want to transact in something “off the books”? It’s called cash. Sure the supply is potentially unlimited. Have you noticed the proliferation of crypto currencies?

Oh come on. You’re ignoring everything he said in the segment I’m talking about.

Of course people expect returns. Duh. But what they said is that ICOs are securities if buyers expect returns *from a third party*.

Who’s the third party in 2017 ICOs? The issuer.

In Bitcoin? LOL
