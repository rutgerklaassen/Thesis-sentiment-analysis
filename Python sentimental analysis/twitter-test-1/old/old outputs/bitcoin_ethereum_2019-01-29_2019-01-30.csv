Ethereum doesn't rely on the security of the Bitcoin blockchain so it's not a ""sidechain to Bitcoin"".

WBTC is simply a tokenized representation of BTC.

Exactly the incentives for running an XRP node are very similar to those for running a Bitcoin full node. You get access the the network itself, and you participate in strengthening the network.

It's great you are helping to organize Ethereum dapp devs / businesses to strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem.

I also want to see the third group, investors, the most disorganized and poorly represented, fund full-time positions to participate in the ETH decision-making process!

...millions from illiterate noobs w/ a premined clone of bitcoin falsely sold as ""not money but utility token"" in order to develope sci-fi things like ""world computers"", ""environmentalist consensus"" & ""unstoppable applications"", all of which now manifestly debunked, isn't a scam.

A sidechain is a different chain that uses the same native asset as another chain, where that asset can be locked/unlocked on the respective chains via a 2-way peg.

's Liquid are examples of these. Now Ethereum is another example.

Core is not a person nor group of people. It is an open source project that many unrelated people work together on. Nobody can speak ""for Core"".

Additionally, even if all of us were to agree on something, we are not infallible, perfect, nor do we control Bitcoin.
