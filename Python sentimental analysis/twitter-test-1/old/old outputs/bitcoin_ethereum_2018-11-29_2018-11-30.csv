And Ethereum and Bitcoin are probably 2 of those 3. With Ethereum holding pretty much all the other crypto assets. I think that's the most reasonable expectation with the empirical evidence currently available.

Had dinner with my mom last night and she asked if Bitcoin is at $2.5K yet because she wants to buy. She does not even have an email account.

The point is people want to buy Bitcoin, but they want to buy it for cheap. So the demand is there, it is just haggling over prices now.

I think the people using Bitcoin in this way are essentially doing so for ideological reasons. And that's not a very good driver for large scale merchant adoption. You see it in places like New Hampshire with Free Staters. They're putting ideology over convenience and cost.

I honestly don't know why anyone would want to use bitcoin for small purchases. The fees are higher, there are accounting burdens and you pay the opportunity cost of losing your btc. I can understand why a large HODLer might want to diversify but that's not what incents merchants
