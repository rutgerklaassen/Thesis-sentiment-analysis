At least $1.. Also..

1 - Launch of Bakkt Exchange
2 - Approval of VanEck Bitcoin ETF

If those two events occur then institutional investors (whales) will consider cryptographic currency legitimate, which I believe will trigger  the biggest bull run in financial history.

You wonder rightfully. If it doesn't synchronize with the blockchain either by using your own node or having one at the background, I think it's safe to assume it queries unknown source (most likely Ledger themselves), exposing your IP and Bitcoin addresses.
