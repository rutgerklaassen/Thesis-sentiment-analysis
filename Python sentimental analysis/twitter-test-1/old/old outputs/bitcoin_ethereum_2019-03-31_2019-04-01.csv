Calling the exchange hacks a Bitcoin problem is like getting your credit card stolen and calling it a Bank of America problem. I agree it's a major issue, but not with Bitcoin itself.

Fwiw Taylor I wish there was a way to recover the Parity multisig funds without opening up pandoras box.

My main concern is that it would signal to the world that a small group can coerce the Ethereum community into performing irregular state changes.
