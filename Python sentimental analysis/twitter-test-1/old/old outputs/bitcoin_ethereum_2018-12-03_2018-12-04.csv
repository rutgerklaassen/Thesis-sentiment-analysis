You should take a serious look at Burst. Proof of capacity based (Vs Bitcoin's Proof of Work) and completely decentralized.

 what the hell is this exclusive attitude, is this the CULT at ABC now? Is Bitcoin about exclusion of people thru IQ censorship or some kind of superiority complex? I thought that was the domian of the BTC cult? seems like the cancer has spread to the ABC.

Jimmy once theorized of an idea that he figured would have to be centralized but was in fact already built on Ethereum.

Random Idea: I want a token that acts as a short for another token. So ETHSHORT would go up when ETH goes down and vice-versa. The underlying would be centralized and would need to use derivatives, but that's something I suspect would actually be useful.

it's a poisson distribution. I believe the longest inter-block period in Bitcoin was something like 600 minutes back in 2009. But you get normal variance up to 90 minutes a few times a year
