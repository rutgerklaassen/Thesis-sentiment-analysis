Why? Lightning Network is a perfect Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin's Layer 1 network. Unlimited TPS, great privacy, ""unfairly low fees"", fully trustless. What seems to be the problem?

The difference between you and I is that you want to remove the state (I won't stop you, or get in the way), and I want the state to be honest and I believe that Bitcoin can force the state to be honest. War expenses will be transparent, trade will open, corruption will shrink

We would need new legislation giving an existing agency (like the SEC or the CFTC) regulatory authority over spot bitcoin markets, or creating a brand new agency for that purpose.
