Why? Lightning Network is a perfect Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin's Layer 1 network. Unlimited TPS, great privacy, ""unfairly low fees"", fully trustless. What seems to be the problem?

The difference between you and I is that you want to remove the state (I won't stop you, or get in the way), and I want the state to be honest and I believe that Bitcoin can force the state to be honest. War expenses will be transparent, trade will open, corruption will shrink
