Yeah I’m kinda surprised it’s not already a key part of an existing platform like dragonchain or ethereum. Would be a great differentiator and also help to ease regulatory fears/pro-consumer protections are always a plus in my book.

I expect BCH to be hella bearish in the coming few months and be an absolute monster in the later part of the year. 

When everyone gives up on BCH because Lightning and Bitcoin Segwit seem to have won the war, back up the truck.

you get an ethereum wallet (
