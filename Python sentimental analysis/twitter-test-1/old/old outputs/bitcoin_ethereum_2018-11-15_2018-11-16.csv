1. Bitmain invests $110M in Circle (owner of Poloniex). 

2. Fake bcash drama.

3. Poloniex is 1st exchange to list chain split tokens BCHABC / BCHSV ""to empower customers to demonstrate their support for one coin over the other through trading activity"". Will support both mkts.

Outsider perspective always surprises me.
Recently, somebody was telling me that there are more Bitcoins than XRP. And I was like, I assure you, there aren’t. And they said “There are many Bitcoins -Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and more. But there is only 1 XRP. Must not be popular.”

Is bitcoin decentralized if decision making is owned by a handful of wealthy miners? Don't get me wrong, I love crypto & whole ""no central authority"" narrative, but this hash war built upon ego & stupidity of some, showcased a authoritarian side of crypto not good for adoption.
