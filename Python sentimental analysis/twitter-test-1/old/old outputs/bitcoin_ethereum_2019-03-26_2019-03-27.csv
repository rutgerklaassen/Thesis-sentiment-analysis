I attended 
@RadxChange
 to connect with a cross-section of artists, acedemics, activists, and others including the Ethereum community. I'd love to be friends, that starts with assuming good on behalf of all involved. Maybe in the future we can sit together and share what we know.

He was soo way off. The forked chain experienced hyperinflation, strip mining, and extremely long block times and required a separate hard fork afterwards to fix the intentional emergency difficulty drop ""bug"". Bitcoin just experienced minor inconvenience.

Yeah, but Bitcoiners are silly sometimes. All he did AFAIK was telling them what Bitcoin was. If CIA *wanted* to infiltrate they should have talked to him in private and we would never have known. No, Gavin’s biggest blunder was believing in Faketoshi. That was *really* stupid.

transferred $X worth of #bitcoin to a hospital in Cambodia for an emergency, lifesaving surgery for a relative of one of our close friends.  I was paid back in full. It was legit. 9/10 times that sort of thing is the wrong decision. It wasn't in this case.

Indeed 

Not sure fully DAO is the next logical step, but an open structure with remote-first labour coordination makes lots of sense. 

Unlocking wealth with fair (transparent info), open (anyone can join), and social (peer-to-peer) markets, natively built on Bitcoin.

One, incredibly, there are still people engaged in these pursuits who are actively using systems that are deadly to them.

It's not just Kushner using WhatsApp to communicate with conspirators.

They keep arresting people involved with bitcoin &/or the Darknet who have *no* idea.
