There's simply no good reason to hate on Dandelion. It's good work by researchers such as 
@giuliacfanti
 and is generally looked favorably. Zcoin gave credits to the researchers and even if some see it as a testnet for Dandelion for Bitcoin's adoption, so be it, it's good tech.

That's ridiculous; payment channels have been part of the core value proposition for Bitcoin since the beginning. Nothing prevents people from making large-volume off-chain payments today, let alone with Liquid.

You seem to be arguing in favor of a block size decrease, actually.
