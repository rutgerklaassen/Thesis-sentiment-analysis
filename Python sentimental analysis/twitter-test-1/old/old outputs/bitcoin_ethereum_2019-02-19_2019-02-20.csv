The reactions below your posts are extremely similar to the ones below posts critical about #Bitconnect when this was huge...

You hate the man for no good reason except he admits to being Sotoshi? He cares about the success of the original bitcoin protocol, and is calling out all of these illegal token scams. Suppose it makes sense for those involved to hate him.

Bitcoin will succeed in China as a superior SOV.  Chinese have been buying up foreign assets in order to preserve their wealth for decades as the RMB loses value.  Cap flight has affected property values in Canada, NY, and SF.  BTC is a more convenient SOV than gold or RE.

well - it depends on your goals. if you want to own a little $BTC the way you'd own $TSLA in your Schwab / eTrade account, by all means use Coinbase. 

if you are a person who wants to own bitcoin as an alternative to surveillance capitalism, DO NOT use coinbase.

i'm the latter.
