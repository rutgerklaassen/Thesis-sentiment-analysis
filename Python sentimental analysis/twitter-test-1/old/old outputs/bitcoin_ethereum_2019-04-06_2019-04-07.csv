Digging in the crates. 2007. @pmarca presciently describes the emergence of ""Level 3 internet platforms,"" ideas now being realized by smart contract platforms. 

The critical difference is that developers need not trust the platform +we call it Web 3.0

USD is global reserve currency of Fiat system, Bitcoin is main currency to trade within crypto. Almost all crypto currencies are correlated with BTC. #STEEM is less correlated with BTC because we‚Äôve our own economy as BTC loose it‚Äôs market share, #STEEM  will rise exponentially

Just want some clarification, I honestly don‚Äôt know the answer.  There is 1,800 BTC daily inflation, and BTC is doing 360,000 transactions per day. That‚Äôs .005 bitcoin per transaction, or $25 at $5000 bitcoin, which is $50 at 10K and $100 at 20K BTC. What am I missing?

TLDR: ZK Rollups are like plasma, but with instant transfers in & out.

They're mainly limited by how much data you can store onchain. With just the current chain, you can get 500 tps. But after Phase1 of Eth2, there'll be so much storage you can get 200,000+ tps on #Ethereum.

I don't get his argument with Polkadot being permissioned, if you want to make sure your parachain stays in place you can stake the DOTs yourself, it'll be more expensive but it'll still be possible. 
I really don't see a problem with this form of governance
