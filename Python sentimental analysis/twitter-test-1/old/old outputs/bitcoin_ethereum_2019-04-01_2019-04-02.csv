What matters is time to transaction finality, when the transaction becomes irreversible.

Credit card and bank transactions can take 60-180 days.

Bitcoin is ~10 minutes.

ETH/XRP/USDC never reach finality, they can always be reversed.

Halvings historically brought value to Bitcoin because a lot of circulating coins (not hodl'd or lost) come directly from mining and thus when this inflow cuts in half, the supply dwindles and the price climbs.  Not sure about this one though, I think some of it'll be priced in
