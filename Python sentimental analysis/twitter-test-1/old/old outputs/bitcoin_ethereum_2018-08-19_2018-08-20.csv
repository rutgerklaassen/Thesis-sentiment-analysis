A more relevant metric would be energy per transaction. A bitcoin fan estimates the banking system at 100TWh per year, Bitcoin at 28.67. Bitcoin does 225,000 transactions per day; *Visa alone* does 150m daily on average. I make that 190x as much energy for Bitcoin transactions.

I would say ""the commonly used address format for Ethereum does not have checksums, while the Bitcoin ones do"".

There are other ways of communicating outputs where the question doesn't apply though. For example Lightning or BIP70 payment requests.

Devices in the off position (DVRs, TVs, toasters, etc.) currently use more electricity than Bitcoin mining.    In fact, “off” devises use about $19 billion dollars of electricity per year in America alone.    How come you aren’t calling for a ban on DVRs and TVs?

Thus, the equilibrium price settles right at the point where the cost from mining doesn't outweigh the benefit from the bitcoins generated through mining. Bitcoin is only energy efficient if it is worthless in the real world. 3/n

The Bitcoin protocol only has scripts. Addresses are shorthand notations for a certain subset of scripts.

And the protocol has no checksums for scripts (nor does it need to).
