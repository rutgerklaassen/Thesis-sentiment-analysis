If we had to start a bull run from here and you could only own 5 coins (#Bitcoin $btc excluded obviously), what would you absolutely want to have in your folio?

Who is the old guard? Who is the new guard? How does one “guard” Bitcoin? When specifically did the new guard take over? How did they change the way Bitcoin is guarded?

Choosing a balanced portfolio for experienced traders is fairly easy, having to choose 1 coin at this time is really hard.

Bitcoin is the expected safest choice though. $ETH is just a bit more ballsy

Risk/Reward. It can go to 20$, 50$ (or even $0) - but it can also go to $1.200, or even 3-4k. Bitcoin will be around 50$K + by then though. 

But hey, some of this is maybe wishful thinking.

I could make a pretty interesting talk on this. There are a number of topics in my head I've never seen discussed WRT thermodynamics, entropy, and Bitcoin. Not going to change the world, but interesting to justify that Bitcoin is an energy commodity & why.
