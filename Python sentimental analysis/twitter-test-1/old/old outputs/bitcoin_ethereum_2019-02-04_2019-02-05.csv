There were definitely bugs back then. You can't fix the past. Getting rid of the bugs is the sane, maintainable path. If there were bugs in bitcoin 2 years ago, you wouldn't rewrite the blockchain today and undo 2 years of txns.

Depends on perspective I guess.

I'm one of those ""everything but Bitcoin is a scam"" types. So I bought what I considered to be a scam knowing that I'd be able to sell it to a greater fool. It was at least in a morally grey area.

I'd probably do it again for more BTC though.
