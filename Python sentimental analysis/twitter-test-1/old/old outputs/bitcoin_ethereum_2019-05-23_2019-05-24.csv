The sky’s the limit for #bitcoin and nothing can stop it. We are changing the world. You either adapt to the changes or get left behind.

This is why #Bitcoin is not a good currency. It will primarily be a store of value. Deflation causes people to forego spending. This is problematic for economic growth but ironically good for the environment (discourages frivolous consumption) and good for household savings. twitter.com/davidgokhshtei…

How do you define a ""sidechain""? It can be argued that Ethereum is a ""sidechain"" of Bitcoin already because of WBTC. 

The term itself has become quite meaningless.

Low-hanging fruit:
- training of people to operate crypto for businesses
- more fun/edu tools like burner wallet
- facilitating integrations with Ethereum mainnet by non-giant but established SaaS
- organize several large marketing campaigns
