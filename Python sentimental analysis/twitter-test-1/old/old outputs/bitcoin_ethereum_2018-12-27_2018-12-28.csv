EOS is the clear winner right now. Neither BTC nor Ethereum can touch EOS and its core features.

Binance is focused on their own chain while Coinbase is focused on Ethereum. 

A question to ask: Is Web3 more synonymous with Ethereum applications?

Another reason why self key generation with dice and paper or other medium is a better way to store your Bitcoin even though r/Bitcoin likes to shill that on trezors and HD keys are ""the only"" safe approach. DYOR!

Just as Nouriel believes his tweets can and will eventually bring Bitcoin to $0, I get the feeling BTC maximalist folks consciously or subconsciously feel they can do the same to ETH whenever the price shows some weakness. I‚Äôm afraid neither camp will succeed. GL & cheers anyway.

To me the italic capital ‚ÄúB‚Äù looks a little funny. I really like straight capital ‚ÄúB‚Äù with the possibility of italic ‚Äúsv‚Äù which makes it clear that the word ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù stands out on it‚Äôs own.

Litecoin is just this worthless thing your dipstick relative buys at $300 from Coinbase after years of you badgering them about Bitcoin (because their gym buddy mentioned 'Crypto', and they wanted to be able to buy a whole '1'). #TrueStory

For the record, I‚Äôm not looking to declare victory‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt a fight between Bitcoin and XRP Ledger in my mind; I find such feuds counterproductive.

I‚Äôm looking to dispel misconceptions about and educate others about XRP Ledger and hopefully learn new things as well.
