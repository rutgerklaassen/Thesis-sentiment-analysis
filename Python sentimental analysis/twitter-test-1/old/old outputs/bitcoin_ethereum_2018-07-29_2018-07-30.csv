Done with crazy market today. Stopped by to check on my trusty old $BTC / $USDT #Binance trade bot. This thing is fucking awesome every single day.

It has been so reliable I would sell it as a whole right now for highest bids, possibly =p

Will give any like / share 1 indicator!

From Bitcoin.

The whitepaper explained the basic idea, but didn't go into all details of the design.

Bitcoin, as defined by the source code published a few months later, fleshed out many of those details. A few others were updated in subsequent versions.

That's not accurate is it? I thought the 21 million cap was part of Bitcoin from the start, but because of a funny way the math worked, after hundreds of years the cap would lift.

Yes and no. Of course the supply was designed to be limited, but before Bitcoin Core 0.9.2 that wasn't what was actually implemented due to a subtle overflow bug. BIP42 actually fixes that bug, but was a joke because it's written from the perspective that it was intentional.
