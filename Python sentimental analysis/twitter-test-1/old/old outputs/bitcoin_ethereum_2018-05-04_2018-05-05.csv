Bitcoin Core is not a cryptocurrency, it's a client program, or possibly a musical genre. The paper you are referring to is actually about bitcoin.

 I liked this account better when the cheetah took it over for a few days. Bring back the cheetah.

You can't make a completely honest statement can you? Misleading people isn't the way to prove you're the better choice.

Segwit uses pay-2-script hash. Which was introduced in 2012. What's your fucking problem with P2SH?

Claiming it is something new is a lie.

What do you mean with a wallet from 2010? Do you mean a node software version?

And than you will check if that wallet sees the transaction you make with BTC and BCH?

Had the most consensus at time of fork. In any case the bitcoin cash narrative is not "" we will be the true bitcoin once we get consensus"" It's "" We are the true bitcoin"". Which is it...

When I bought I would have bought bitcoin if it were just for profits vs XRP. I didnt because of the technical benefits of XRP.

The whole point of the cypherpunk venture that gave birth to Bitcoin is that the tax day cannot come for pseudonymous identities. Take me, for example. I have lost all my btcs in a bot accident (I was in the other boat that crashet against 
@fluffypony
's one). Prove me wrong.

I can't argue with a zealot who quotes scripture every time there is an arguement. Satoshi himself recognized the need for evolution, and the idea of second layers originated with him.  Please do show me where it says that a fork without consensus can be considered the original.
