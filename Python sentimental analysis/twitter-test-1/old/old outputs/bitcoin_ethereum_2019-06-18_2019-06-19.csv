Libra competes for apps that don't require censorship-resistance. (Basically everything that EOS and Tron is used for, RIP.) Libra doesn't compete with Open Finance on Ethereum, which is currently the main value prop.

Until your altcoin successfully defeats a coordinated attack like NYA/S2X, with 90% of the hashrate and major businesses trying to force a hard fork, its immutability is untested and its monetary policy is suspect.
