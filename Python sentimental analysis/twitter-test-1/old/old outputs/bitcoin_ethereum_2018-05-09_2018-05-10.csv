Starting tomorrow all of the governments and banks of the world declare it illegal to use or own.

I guarantee that will cripple it severely.

Fortunately, I don't see that happening.

But a FUD war against bitcoin is coming that will pale by comparison Buffet and Gates comments.

That's because Bitcoin is the Sun while Ethereum behaves perhaps more like an unpredictable star

If you mean Bitcoin Cash than I would strongly disagree.

1.) Bitcoin Cash is a type of Bitcoin (shares Bitcoin's Genesis block)
2.) Bitcoin Cash is decentralized. (https://cash.coin.dance/blocks)

Please show evidence for your claims

To make this comparison fair, you would need to account for local languages. For example, in the Netherlands they would would search for ""Bitcoin kopen"" rather than ""Buy Bitcoin"". Right now the data is skewed for EN speaking countries. #stats and #stuff

also i'd qualify that: finance journalists would LOVE to cover this stuff but it's sorta obscure and stupid, so mainstream editors don't go for it

bitcoin journalists tend to only cover might-not-be-good news if it's so egregious they can't not
