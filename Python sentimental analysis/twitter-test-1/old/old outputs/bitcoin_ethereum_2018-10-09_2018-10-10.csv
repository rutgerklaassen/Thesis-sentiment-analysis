because people want to accumulate as much bitcoin as possible before everyone else realises they should buy it

and because they want to redirect people learning about bitcoin into buying their made up assets instead

Your tweet implies that China controls 74% of the supply (bitcoin = currency, Bitcoin = network), which is misleading. They claim 74% of the hashrate comes from Chinese mining pools, but don't disclose sources/heuristics. This figure contradicts both public info & common sense.

False premise. Nobody runs bitcoin. That is why it is so hard to make changes to it.  

Jihan and Roger V, on the other hand, by their own admissions,""run"" Bcash. They hardfork BCash every month (i.e. centrally controlled).

Not really most projects are crowding each other out. I don’t think FB or Twitter would have made it if started in ‘97. That’s why I stick with bitcoin. Money is a universal need. Smart contracts, storage, kitties not so much.

Market Cap is the number of circulating coins TIMES the current price.  There are just over 17 million BItcoins, and about 40 billion XRP.  That means Bitcoin would need a much higher value than XRP to hit the same market cap.
