Jan 24, 2018","It is perfectly legitimate to support both sides of a fork such as the BTC / BCH one. The fork allows divergent visions to be expressed and tested in the marketplace.
Holders automatically hold both sides, businesses can choose to support users on both, like 
@bitcoin
.com does.

@CoinMarketCap Can we get the BCH site http://bitcoin.com and its forum moved from https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/… to https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/… please? They support the other side of the fork and don't specify that their wallets are BCH not BTC.

You must to do your homework. Do some research. A fork (aka airdrop) does not change the number of bitcoins. It just creates a parallel blockchain that may be worthless or give birth to something of value. It is like giving away a coupon to all bitcoin holders.

Like so many, I believed Bitcoin would become the new money.  It did not.  But Dash can do that.   Dash + Stripe = awesome.

If cheap fees were what give bitcoin it's value then one of its myriad competitors that offer that would have taken it over by now. Obviously the market is telling a different story.
