Hodling Bitcoin carried a significant opportunity cost- the ability to hodl other assets. It's the exact opposite of free riding.

Users that get paid are usually merchants. For a merchant it's not a big deal at all to have a 24h online server. And by the way a raspberry pi is enough for a Bitcoin/LN full node. So pretty much everyone can have a LN node online 24h anyway.

I have LN wallet on my phone. All I need is to go online once in a few days. And again, banks are fine if they are just private businesses. you can't prevent someone creating  currency fractionally  backed by bitcoin.

Bitcoin has a meritocratic process and only broadens the rules if the change gets full consensus (meaning no shadow of a doubt). There is no room nor welcome for politics.

Bitcoin Ben was never a board member.  He was a volunteer for the Foundation. He made a mistake at one of his meetups, and was provided the opportunity to recant. People make mistakes in life and Ben in general is a good man who did that. I for one, refuse to act above anyone.

Oh shoot, that‚Äòs why I was so confused  Well, Pasc has been one of the most underrated coins for a long time. If it was added to Binance some time ago it would be in the top50 right now and praised as the new Bitcoin. (That‚Äòs how it works right?

You‚Äôre making my point for me: the hyper-creditized economy is fragile, despite what some Harvard-trained economists argue.

Bitcoin (BCH) and a strong p2p _cash_ economy disintermediates banks because we no longer need them for payments. LN on the other hand entrenches them.

Let me stop you right there. 

They, like both yourself and Roger, have no idea what they are talking about and have been proven wrong for YEARS now. No one left to listen to you except for people who have no idea who you are.
