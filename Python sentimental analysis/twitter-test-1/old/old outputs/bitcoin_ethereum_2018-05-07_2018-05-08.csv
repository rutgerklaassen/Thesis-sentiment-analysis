Their investing style has never been to anticipate future trends and benefit from them!  They should not try to invest in Social Media or Bitcoin!  It doesn't mean they are wrong or right, it means you missed the point of their strategy.

San Fran FED is wrong. Futures volumes on the CME and CBOE bitcoin contracts were too low to cause the price decline from 19K to 7K. I have 5 reasons that caused the ‚Äúcrash‚Äù. Can tell you about it sometime, not on Twitter.

This is because with many coins, mining difficulty changes every block (unlike Bitcoin's every 2 weeks), plus miners are always joining and leaving different networks, so a profitability calculator snapshot will almost never be accurate.
