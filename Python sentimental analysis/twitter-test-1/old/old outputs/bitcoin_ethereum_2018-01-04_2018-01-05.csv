We've heard the ""technical limitations"" argument before, in fact, before Bitcoin. Technical limitations was given as a reason why something like Bitcoin couldn't exist in the first place. Saying he read the white paper first or ran a mailing list is fallacious and nonsense.

The penalty for falling out of consensus, or attempting a ledger rewrite, is huge in Bitcoin (wipeout of block rewards). In Ripple consensus, I have to trust the majority of validators.
