Erik do you still believe after everything that the folks backing Segwit2X (Bitmain, Ver, everyone behind BCH) actually just wanted a 2MB increase?

This was a battle of power & control over bitcoin.

Conservatism vs move fast & break things.

BCH has 32 MB blocks, wants g-blocks

The biggest threat to Bitcoin is apathy. Same thing that lead to fractional reserve banking and abandoning the gold standard.

Bitcoin from v0.1 was set in stone. Satoshi mentioned this, he then went on to mention people will realise the importance of staying with the official version. He mentioned he didn’t like his software forked.
How is it then that Segwit was activated through a user activated fork?

Nobody commands Bitcoin. Nobody that supported SegWit2x wanted anyone in “command.” It’s a propagandistic tool to avoid debate on the topic of scale and strategic disagreement.

My biggest regret of 2018 is dabbling in Bitcoin Cash. Most of my BTC I either mined, or bought below $100. I lost only a few million dollars on BCH, but lost even more net worth with the bear market bringing down everything. Hoping for a bull market soon!

Label it with whatever -ism you prefer, but it clearly appeals to anyone who aims to advanced individuals' liberties.

I suspect Satoshi and most early Bitcoin users would agree, but perhaps I'm wrong, why do you consider this troubling?

Forks are not necessarily scams because they can still win. Altcoins can't win because they're an attempt to start over with a new economy whereas someone intelligent would prefer to go where people are already cooperating in the Bitcoin economy.

bitcoin mining was *insanely* profitable in the bubble, the limit was how fast Bitmain could churn out S9s (and how much they could charge). It didn't go to 1:1 until Nov 2018. some notes:

The Bitcoin hash rate for the past year, and the squeeze that crypto miners find themselves in
In a bubble, Bitcoin miners can do very well. But what bubbles do is … pop.
