Ideal Bitcoin-like censorship resistance aside, banks/payment processors should be held responsible for their discriminative practices against crypto companies. Can’t wait for the first successful crypto lawsuit against banks using discrimination as ground-argument.

A third scenario is speculating on the future growth rate of a currency’s adoption. If the growth rate is greater than the rate at which new tokens are created, then the value will go up — “deflation” in monetary economics terms.

Bitcoin is still growing. The market is absorbing 1800 new coins per day. When the halving kicks in we’ll see the supply to meet the current demand drop, and after this happens 1-5 times that will have a natural upward pressure on price and bring attention to ₿ again.

There's under 100k full nodes nowadays. How many people do you think own bitcoins? Unless your answer is ""under 120k people"", the situation is bad. And if there are over 200k people, the situation is very dire.

If we don't act to rectify it, Bitcoin WILL fail eventually.

Furthermore, ratio of bitcoin holders using their own full nodes has been dropping rapidly for several years now, likely well below any safe threshold. It is not exaggerating to say this may very well be Bitcoin's #1 existential threat at this point.
