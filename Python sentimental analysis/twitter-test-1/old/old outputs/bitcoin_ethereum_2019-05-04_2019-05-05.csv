Not enough in this community appreciate that Ethereum‚Äôs success as a technology will be irrelevant if it‚Äôs not a widely adopted economic and social network.

No one is asking those folks to conceal truth, but it would nice to leave trolling to BTC Maxis instead of our own devs.

He‚Äôs 88 years old, worth approx $90B, is considered one of the most prolific investors of all time. 

He doesn‚Äôt fear Bitcoin; the uber wealthy, at that age, don‚Äôt pivot. He‚Äôs planted his stake in the ground on the subject, don‚Äôt expect change.

You want to (a) talk about a Bitcoin scaling issue (b) on the internet and (c) want people to be civil about it.  It's a trilemma, you can only have two of the above.
