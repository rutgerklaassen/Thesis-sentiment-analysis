I mean, BTC is Bitcoin Core ever since Bitcoin XT was considered an alt-coin topic by consensus in the BTC community.

""letting this happen""??  Dude, it's already happened.  This is why BCH exists.  BCH is a preservation of bitcoin prior to all the BS that has happened to BTC since Aug 2017.

Buy flashcoin, why wait 10 minutes at the cash register for your bitcoin transaction to go when $Flash can confirm your transaction in 2.5 seconds?

It's all good Eric. Perhaps someday we'll run Bitcoin on top of Ethereum - of course after a pure substrate has been provisioned on-chain that meets the standards of Bitcoin maximalists. 

*winks*

Great dialog btw

What‚Äôs the true size and scope of the bitcoin OTC market?

How many humans (not addresses or wallets) hold bitcoin?

What ‚Äòshitcoins‚Äô do bitcoin maximalists secretly hold?

I think they're mad that http://Purse.io made BCash an implementation, so they wanted to make Bitcoin Core a currency.

I honestly can't blame them for trying, but it's hilarious how much of a failure their attempt has been.

C'mon...had the hack been over a few thousand instead of millions of dollars - or had the contract not been a pet project for several Ethereum founders, do you really think this course of action would have been pursued?
