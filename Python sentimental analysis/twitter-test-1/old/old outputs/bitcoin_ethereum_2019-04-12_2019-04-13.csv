There is only one Bitcoin

May 1 is known as Labor Day, a protest day for working people worldwide

Proof of Work drives Bitcoin

May 1 should become Bitcoin Restoration Day

#DelistBSV from all legitimate exchanges on May 1

5 major VC firms own all of the media, exchanges & pay developer teams of all the mainstream projects which overthrew the real governance of bitcoin. Now their paid influencers trash anyone who doesn’t bow to their narrative. 

Finally, someone has the resources to push back.

What good would we do for the ecosystem as opposed to Ripple building it out with the money they make from the sales?  Nobody is more motivated and best-positioned to decide where distributing that xrp makes the most sense.  It's no different than Bitcoin mining rewards
