Hello Carter. I watch your show everyday. I live in a small village in Kazakhstan. I sold both my younger sisters and our goat to buy bitcoin at the all time high of 20k. When it dropped to 6k I got scared and sold it. Now we have no sisters, goat, or bitcoin. What should I do?

I like Bitcoin but you're dreaming if you can't see how game changing alt coins are & how much Bitcoin needs them to get anywhere near adoption. If we want a tokenised economy, we need a plethora of projects to succeed. A top project is a top project, blockchain - the future.
