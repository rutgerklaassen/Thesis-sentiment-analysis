If you trade alts and screw up...or if your exchange gets hacked...you could also drop to close to 0x. Holding Bitcoin is much easier and less risky, and 20x returns in 2 years is still WAY better ROI than most investments.

Who takes Craig Wright seriously? 

I suspect the nChain patent applications are similar to Wright's tech papers: technobabble mixed with misappropriated ideas that don't make sense in the context he's using them.

But Bitcoin is permissionless so we're stuck with a few crazies.
