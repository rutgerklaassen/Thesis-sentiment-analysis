I love bitcoin I just don’t see how one can be an advocate for decentralization and bitcoin maximalism at the same time. It’s like a freed slave seeking a new master.

Huge spillover, massive competition, sluggish tech uptake, stablecoins will make ETH obsolete for ICO/STOs.

9/ Remember prices here are not necessarily cheap. $ETH still is 10x higher than in Dec 2016. Do you know any assets outside of crypto that are up +900% in 2 years?

Possibly. These will be very slow to take off for various reasons. Complex topic. Either way, the main drive behind ETH run up were not the ERC20 tokens issued on Ethereum, but the fact that the ICOs required to be paid in ETH. STOs will not require to be paid in ETH.

Either BTC price will continue to rise and demand for Layer 1 transactions will also continue rise, or Bitcoin will eventually fail. There is no non-21M capped Bitcoin. My full node won’t validate those blocks. Feel free to create yet another MinerCoin on your own though!
