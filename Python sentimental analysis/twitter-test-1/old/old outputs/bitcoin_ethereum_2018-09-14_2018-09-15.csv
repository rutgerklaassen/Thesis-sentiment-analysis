BTC may have ceased to be real cash. For Bitcoin it's axiomatic.

Lightning Network is not a cash system, no settlement until you exit. You have counter-party relationships to maintain and monitor. Nothing like Bitcoin in the sense of cash.

Not exactly — third quadrant is “Bitcoin, not Blockchain”. Meaning, belief in BTC, but not in the blockchain as a technology that provides meaningful benefit outside the context of Bitcoin.

So if someone figured out a way to issue freezable colored coins on the bitcoin blockchain, that new innovation would retroactively mean that the bitcoin blockchain had been centralized all along? You can't possibly believe that.

Tokens will hash & attest back against main bitcoin industrial chain, making bitcoin more valuable because it will be used to validate 2nd layer networks built on top of it 

most important thing is decentralized POW based industrial (base) layer the rest doesn’t matter

...accept it even if it doesn't come with an embedded get rich scheme. Nobody is pushing altcoins because of their love for truth. Altcoin pushers just want to get rich quick because ""muh new Bitcoin"". That's anti-scientific, fanaticism, driven by greed.
