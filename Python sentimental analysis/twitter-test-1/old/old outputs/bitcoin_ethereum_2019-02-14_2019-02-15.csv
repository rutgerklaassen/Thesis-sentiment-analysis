Seriously Ben, do your homework. This article and especially the title is downright embarrassing.  If anything, it validates the #Bitcoin dream!

If I was Polkadot I’d want to get as much Ethereum comparison debate going so I can justify my valuation during the raise I’m trying to close.

I wasn’t talking about that.

My concern is we have to start developing ASAP Bitcoin tools that DO NOT require any previous Bitcoin knowledge so any business or government can implement them for running a supply chain, criminal records, etc.

International standard has arrived. It is borderless, permissionless, trustless, censorship resistant, inflation resistant, globally neutral, globally valued and globally traded.
It is called Bitcoin.

100%, in fact moreso because 'today' China can unilaterally decide to destroy Bitcoin by ordering its 9 mining pools to double-spend attack Bitcoin, and nobody would know till it's too late.  Whereas the XRP ledger is completely decentralized and no single authority can affect it

No but to refer to $BSV as Bitcoin would be fair in my opinion. The vision is great the team are capable of delivering. This is Bitcoin at its best, fully functional groundbreaking tech and sound money all in one.

This betrays a deep misunderstanding of monetary competition (hint, victory is all about hardness aka credibility of monetary policy) - #bitcoin is superior and will continue to outcompete.

It’s great how Jamie Dimon was able to go from calling crypto a scam to launching a coin. The herd is coming.  This story is not over.

They're basically giving blockchain technology their approval and bringing legitimacy (in the eyes of normies) to cryptocurrency in general.

How can anybody think this is bearish? JP Morgan coin is not competition to #Bitcoin.
