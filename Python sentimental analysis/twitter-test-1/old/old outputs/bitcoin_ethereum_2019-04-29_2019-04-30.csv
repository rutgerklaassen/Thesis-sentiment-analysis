Helping with opening people's eye(s). Well done :)

I think this is partially non-traditional minimum-sophistication short sellers, many of whom grew up on Bitcoin where the social reality of the ticker is the only reality, and partially the counter-cult of personality.

I think people underestimate the second part.

The *orphan risk* costs are large compared to full node costs, but they're proportional to hashrate, so small miners face the same orphan risk costs as medium-sized miners. Very large miners (e.g. 20%) get an advantage, though. Keeping this total advantage small is important.

The #Bcash story is from yesteryear. No need to dig it up again for the 1000th time. We have had more than our bellies full of that nonsense. I find it counterproductive and a real distraction from the building in #bitcoin #LightningNetwork and the Bitcoin Ecosystem.

The only entity you have to trust with

 is the data provider themselves. You suppose that with other oracle models where they essentially use an internal oracle you don’t have to trust outside data?

Amoveo is so cheap right now. It costs less to buy VEO vs trying to maintain a clone.

What happens to the clone when I find bugs in Amoveo? 

The marketing department will do better joining Amoveo instead of trying to clone us.
