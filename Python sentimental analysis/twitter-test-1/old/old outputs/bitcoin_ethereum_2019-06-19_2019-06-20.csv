Also, note how they call the equivalent of miners ""validators"" - they're not expecting _you_ to be able to validate.

You havent reinvented money. Bitcoin did that. You're just applying new technology to build a different payment rail. You're literally using the same old fiat money controlled by central banks.

By the same token, Binance should support existing quality Ethereum projects too.  One reason we built our Unikoin on blockchain is for the network effect it affords us.  Still trying to find a way to make BEP2 work without forking the platform.  A wrapper would be sweet.
