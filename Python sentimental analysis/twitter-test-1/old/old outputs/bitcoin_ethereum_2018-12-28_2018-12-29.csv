It's worth noting that if Ethereum had any sort of product-market fit in line with valuation, they wouldn't have:
(a) totally pivoted from their initial use-case
(b) required major architectural changes after having launched

Countering ad-hominems (re Tuur, who has made major contributions to our understanding of Bitcoin) with more (re Preethi, who has built stuff) is bad, but apriori labeling critics as ""shitting on XYZ on Twitter"" (and holding up ""builders"" as a paragon of virtue) isn't healthy.

/r/bitcoin did a great job censoring truth.

Nice! Keep up the good work.

Maybe you can brainwash the whole world into using the Lightning Network instead of mainnet.

Maximalists come in different shapes/sizes... 

#cryptocurrency joining #bitcoin, showing actual use, security and #value for 10 years, have no fears at all. 

""New coins"" that clutter up #crypto for no reason, detract from the very few good projects, that #BTC has helped fund.

There is no business case for Bitcoin. It simply is what it is. No one controls it or speaks for it.

The case Tuur made was that this is not true, at all, for Ethereum.

Theories are explanations of reality. Austrian economics develops theories to explain why historical events happened as they did. What plans and conclusions you draw from those explanations (Bitcoin, gold, etc.) is your own responsibility.

Stellar has helped other projects get over some of the limitations Ethereum has and really opened up the possibilities. Soma will no doubt benefit greatly too.

Won't be long until more Supply-chain/Authentication solutions follow suit. You guys are one step ahead!

Either install our open source backend (https://github.com/trezor/blockbook‚Ä¶) and use that as a custom backend in our web wallet or wait until we implement PSBT (partially signed Bitcoin transactions) so Trezor can talk to Bitcoin Core directly.
