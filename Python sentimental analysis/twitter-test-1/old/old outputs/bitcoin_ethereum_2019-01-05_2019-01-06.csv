The source of the comment about the scar is from The Satoshi Affair. In that article, you can read the whole back story behind the evidence towards Craig's role in Bitcoin.

Where he got a scar is way less important.

How does Craig know so much if ""fake""?

Too many people make a category error when it comes to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not a tech play like Instagram where you have to constantly innovate to win. 
Bitcoin is a monetary play like gold where stability and security are what make it valuable.
