Agree, it is very little in cryptocurrency if you think of it as a payment system. The fact is that it can become much more than just payments, it can replace a huge part of financial intermediaries.

Every move USA does, makes Bitcoin look more and more appealing. I wonder if Trump has an hidden agenda to empower Bitcoin.

When you price goods & services SOLELY in Bitcoin then you can say separation of money & state

I'm not sure we agree on most of that 

The paradigm that Bitcoin has introduced is precisely that there is NO universal standard when it comes to money. Anything (including TOTALLY imaginary goods like UTXOs) can be money with sufficient consensus.

There will be myriad.
