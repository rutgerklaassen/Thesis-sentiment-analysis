Not true. There was all manner of combinations. Bitcoin pumps, alts dump; bitcoin pumps, alts pump; bitcoin dumps, alts dump, bitcoin dumps, alts pump. Whenever everyone got too cocky w the pattern, it would switch up. I would expect the same this time. We’ll have to see....

Lost in all this is that exchanges like Binance are choosing Ethereum due to lower fees and greater utility. 

Framed differently, they aren’t choosing to stay on Bitcoin because of its greater perceived security even though its security often gets touted.

If you're trading to make more BTC, you should just buy BTC.

The Fed has made bitcoin the obvious choice for wealth preservation. All the politicians talking about confiscation to pay for “free” handouts should go a long way too especially closer to election time.

Shane Ellis theory
Don’t you get it already.
If XRP bounces up and down
It will never be adopted.

Why is this so hard to understand.
There is a reason why NO ONE wants to adopt Bitcoin
There is a reason why institutions are adopting Ripple and XRP

I think there's only such thing as Bitcoin's incentives to good behavior being insufficient. That said, if we define an *anit-social* miner, there's a lot of space:
1) Selfish Mining
2) Block witholding pools
3) Censoring transactions
4) not honoring Replace by Fee
etc
