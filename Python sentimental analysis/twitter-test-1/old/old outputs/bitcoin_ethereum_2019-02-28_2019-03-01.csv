WRONG! The most critical, injustice issue facing our nation, and the future of our great country today, is desolving the FED (Federal Reserve) and adopting Cryptocurrency as our means of exchange.

Bitcoin and open source are products of a free market. 

So is Facebook.  

This was an inevitability. And once again, much better than government run currencies specifically built to monitor citizens.  

This is a pareto-optimal outcome in my view.

Remind me again which crypto was trading higher than BTC when the price was low. 
BCH trading at cents of BTC is a statement from the market. The choice to ignore it is all yours.

I use tons of proprietary apps. My OS is proprietary, so is the processor, and so on and so on.

But Apple controls the phone, not Casa. Casa *does* control the Casa app, *and* the recovery key, so that's 2 keys to a bitcoin stash.

My weather app can't control any bitcoin stash.

Rubbish.

Everyone knows the facts.

Bitcoin(bch) shot it‚Äôs load early by adding a checkpoint.

Then shot it‚Äôs load early again by saying ‚Äòwe‚Äôve won the hash war‚Äô

Worse yet, how about technical changes that may prioritize one use-case over another? The precedent matters here a ton! (see, eg, changes to bitcoin's block size which prioritize certain uses over miners/other uses that are less fee-sensitive).
