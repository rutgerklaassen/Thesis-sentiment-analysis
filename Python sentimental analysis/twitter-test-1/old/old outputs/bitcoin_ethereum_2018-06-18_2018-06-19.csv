Brian makes some good points. But comparing bitcoin to Napster is awful. I know what he's getting at but Napster was shut down. Napster had a central point of failure, bitcoin does not. Bitcoin can not be shut down. You can't file a lawsuit against bitcoin.

Get a notepad out.

Write down all the reasons you bought Bitcoin at $18k.

Read those reasons out loud.

Then ask yourself: do I still believe that reasoning?

If the answer is yes, HODL your ass off.

If the answer is no, you struck the f out, time to salvage anything left.
