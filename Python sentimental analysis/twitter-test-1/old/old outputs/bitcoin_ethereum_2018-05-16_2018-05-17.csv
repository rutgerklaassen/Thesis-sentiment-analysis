If you want to use some tech (e.g. bitcoin) to further your goals, why aren't you doing a deep dive into it? Studying it, implementing it.

Easier to just dream & guess excitedly.

Regarding competition, keypairs generated from the same elliptic curve are interchangeable. Users who have ethereum wallets ""automatically"" have bitcoin wallets etc. Imagine your new social network could automatically utilize twitter user data by default. Very powerful.

In other words, there is no way for ANYONE to know what the application generating a particular address (and associated keypair) is. That is the main property of Bitcoin that gives it privacy. It is a feature, not a bug.

This is new territory for everyone. 
It would be nice to hear what kind of policy exchanges implement. I’m sure the whole Bitcoin vs BitcoinCash has caused them to create some sort of guidance.
