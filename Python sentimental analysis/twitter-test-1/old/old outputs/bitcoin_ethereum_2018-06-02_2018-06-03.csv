If you drive enough Puerto Ricans out of Puerto Rico through infrastructure failure then the big corporations can move in, gentrify, and built 30s-era Cuba. Las Vegas in the Caribbean. Bitcoin Paradise.

Did you seriously just bring up ‚Äúpurchasing power‚Äù when trying to make the case for Bitcoin?  Heroin has a more widely accepted purchasing exchange.

This is exactly the problem. Ethereum classic isn't going around intentionally tricking people into thinking it is Ethereum. bcash is directly and purposely confusing its customers to think they are buying Bitcoin. It is quite clearly fraud.

Point is the role of Bitcoin has been recast, by some, non of whom were its originator. Do others not have the right to pursue their own interpretation?

Wouldn‚Äôt someone who bought into the idea of Bitcoin as peer to peer electronic cash have grounds to claim fraud? Why is BCH?

Bitcoin Cash is not a person, so it can‚Äôt ever say such a thing. People who promote it may, but that doesn‚Äôt mean Bitcoin Cash itself is a fraud. Just like Bitcoin isn‚Äôt a fraud if someone promotes it in dubious ways.

One of my reasons why Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn were serious threats to Bitcoin was precisely because they were making false claims about its capabilities. That quickly turns into outright fraud when there's such huge amounts of investor money involved.

If people are buying Bcash under the belief that Bcash ""is Bitcoin"" or ""as good as Bitcoin"" (which I assure you is happening thanks to extremely deceptive naming), then Bcash itself is absolutely a scam because it is provably NOT Bitcoin and in fact inferior to Bitcoin.

Unsurprisingly, the #IMF article mentions Bitcoin just once and claims that it is only useful for illicit activities.  #ElitePropaganda http://imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2018/06/impact-of-digital-technology-on-economic-growth/muhleisen.htm‚Ä¶

I‚Äôll give you $10,000 AUD if you give me $10,000 USD. Fair is fair. You guys are running around pretending Bcash is Bitcoin, hoping newcomers will flock to your impostor altcoin instead of Bitcoin. If you believe that Bcash was superior to Bitcoin, then rebrand and outcompete.

Funny enough, that site is run by

IMO ""low processing fees"" *should* be taken off the front page; that *is* a misleading way of advertising Bitcoin.

Bitcoin transactions are however pretty fast compared to other methods of payment; I have no issue with that claim.

Stripped size is the term used by Blockchair. It's the size seen by a node not upgraded to understand SegWit . It's the way block size was calculated since the beginning of bitcoin. If this size exceeds 1 MB a hard fork must have happened.

I mean, I understand that spam filtering can be hard to automate. But when someone explicitly reports it and a human looks at it... to have that report rejected as ""not a violation"" is just incompetence or worse.

The article linked here speaks to embracing change or being left behind. However they carefully demonize  ""anonymous crypto currencies like Bitcoin"" while lauding the transformational underlying blockchain technology. Typical talking points...
