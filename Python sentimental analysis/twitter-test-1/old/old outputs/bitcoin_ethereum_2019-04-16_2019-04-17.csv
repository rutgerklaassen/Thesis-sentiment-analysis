What's that old saying? The best time to buy Bitcoin is 10 years ago, the 2nd best time is today.

Something like that.

We have a “Plan B” burger already. It’d be time for Bitcoin cafe! Sound espressos for the win!

I swear #Bitcoin haunts me around the clock and the globe. Just wanted to get lunch. Clearly changed my plans. Amazing burger! (went for double-beef bacon)

They are fighting for customers. Customers wanted more assets to trade 

Having bitcoin's best interest in mind isn't a business model

Watch til the end; I didn't even know about the Quantum Resistance stuff. I feel like $ADA can just skate circles around everyone else. Even Ethereum & Bitcoin; how can a Bitcoin maximalist watch this video and not see that Cardano is Next Level?!

0.5 at any one time has been a safe bet of mine.

Goal is to own 1 BTC without having to trade ALTS in order to accumulate more.

2021 will be when we finally reach #financialFreedom

But this particular case isn't really an issue of which the ""real"" Bitcoin is. It is a case of someone deliberately defrauding people with a long string of provable forgeries. I don't really care about Bitcoin Gold or any of those other tiny forks.

Like going to an exchange to buy Bitcoin but accidentally buying Beetcoin Cash because it was ""cheaper"" and had a similar ticker symbol.

 why follow the same ethics & delist BCH?

Roger still lies & issues propaganda to this day. They created a fake bitcoin chain that doesn't even need mining!

Checkpoints & low hashrate make it very unsecure.

BCH is the scammiest threat to bitcoin success.

The market is just other peoples' opinions about the future. Ideas about the future are falsifiable, but you have to wait.
