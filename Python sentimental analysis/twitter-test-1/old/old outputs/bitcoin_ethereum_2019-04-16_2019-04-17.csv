Can you mine bitcoin using a hamster wheel, a diode, a few EEPROMs cribbed from old Street Fighter and Galaga consoles, and a few amped-up hamsters if you feed the hamsters plenty of acorns and hummus?  Asking for a friend who‚Äôs TOTALLY NOT STARTING A HEDGE FUND.

What's that old saying? The best time to buy Bitcoin is 10 years ago, the 2nd best time is today.

Something like that.

They are fighting for customers. Customers wanted more assets to trade

0.5 at any one time has been a safe bet of mine.

Goal is to own 1 BTC without having to trade ALTS in order to accumulate more.

But this particular case isn't really an issue of which the ""real"" Bitcoin is. It is a case of someone deliberately defrauding people with a long string of provable forgeries. I don't really care about Bitcoin Gold or any of those other tiny forks.

Like going to an exchange to buy Bitcoin but accidentally buying Beetcoin Cash because it was ""cheaper"" and had a similar ticker symbol.

 why follow the same ethics & delist BCH?

Roger still lies & issues propaganda to this day. They created a fake bitcoin chain that doesn't even need mining!

Checkpoints & low hashrate make it very unsecure.

BCH is the scammiest threat to bitcoin success.
