At the end of January, bitcoin mining consumed electricity at the rate of 46TWh/yr, more than the ENTIRE country of New Zealand.

It's now 73TWh/yr; on par with the whole of Austria.

80% of the world's countries use less electricity than bitcoin.

Good job calling out Proof-of-Work. Big miss failing to recognize the 'alternative protocol' has already been on the market for over 5 years. In matter of fact, it's ranked 3rd by market cap after Ethereum. Energy consumption negligible, high throughput, decentralized.

Also there are likely two classes of discussions your friend wants to have 
1. What is the smart thing to do with this money? (e.g. don't buy Bitcoin)

2. How do I best minimize tax impact in an ongoing fashion?

Your friend will need both.
