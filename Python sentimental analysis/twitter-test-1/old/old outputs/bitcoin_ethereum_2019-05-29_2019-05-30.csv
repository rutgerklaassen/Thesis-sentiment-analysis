Motivation to build LN is tough. Will core get to it? If we succeed, will they duplicate our work and eliminate our protocol?

Well said Tyler. Quite agree. 

Was thinking the same re the 'Hive'. The innovative mining solution from the team at #LitecoinCash, preventing 51% attack.

Also I feel set to disrupt Crypto mining in General requiring minimal power consumption.

Here is they key, $ftm actually has utility.

So for Dubai to use the tech, they need to buy ftg (fantom gas) and anytime ftg is purchased, an equal amount of ftm is taken out of circulation.

This is what you want in an investment!

Also it’s typeset in OpenOffice with a faux LaTeX configuration in an attempt to ape academic papers...
