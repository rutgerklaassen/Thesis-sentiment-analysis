The funniest thing about calling it a Ponzi is this. Normally in a Ponzi scheme, early investors want to get out with as much as they can once the suckers have piled in. But, with bitcoin, the earlier you got in, the less likely you are to want to cash out.

BCH is Bitcoin since it follows original whitepaper: no Segwit, no RBF, has 0-conf, chain of digital signatures (instead of chain of hashes). BTC has fundamentally changed from that original roadmap. BTC should create own whitepaper to reflect new architecture.

I am all of 50 days old in crypto space. However do have 27 years of trading experience behind & the rules here are the same. Top coins follow TA levels, bottom coins follow whales cash flow (same as penny stocks). So will adjust pretty quickly here. Thank you again buddy.

There is much dichotomy in Bitcoin and a massive war on truth and science. First casualty of war is truth. It is very hard for the layman to sort thru the narratives.

By the time Buffett 1) figures it out, and 2) manages to bring himself to admit he was wrong, 3) nearly all other billionaire investors and financial entities will already own Bitcoin, and Buffett will conclude it's too late to buy what used to be a bargain asset.

Please do not try and confuse new people. BitcoinCash never was until August 2017. The fact that #Bitcoin had some code changes does NOT make it not #Bitcoin. Growth implies change, #Bitcoin grew in one direction you left - get your own name and stop confusing newbies

Buffett could have put in 8-9 figures without being a Bitcoin cheerleader. Upside is so huge that he could have said (as I did) that although it may well go to zero, even a 20% chance it'll be a major asset in a decade makes it a great long-term investment.

Warren Buffet's error is in not recognizing Bitcoin has utility as a disintermediater of trusted third parties, who seek rents on that trust. His point would be otherwise valid AFAICT, and is true of e.g. ripple and other trust-requried ledgers.
