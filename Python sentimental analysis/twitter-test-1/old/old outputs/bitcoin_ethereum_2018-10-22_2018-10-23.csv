Either way, both critiques can't be true.

Either Bitcoin's monetary policy is undesirable, preventing it from taking off. Or(!) Bitcoin's monetary policy is so desirable that it brings down the economy.

(Ofc. there are at least 3/4 other possible scenarios; can only speculate.)

BTW I'm aware of Wei Dai's quote, I included it in my b-money article (https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/genesis-files-if-bitcoin-had-first-draft-wei-dais-b-money-was-it/‚Ä¶). Even if he's right -- I'm not sure -- I don't think that makes Bitcoin useless.

The Dillinger quote is about gold. While arguing Bitcoin isn't like gold, you compare it to gold, lol.

The Genesis Files: If Bitcoin Had a First Draft, Wei Dai‚Äôs B-Money Was It
""Efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a way to enforce contracts,‚Äù Dai explained when he introduced b-money in November of 1998.

Nonsense. That was the narrative that YOU attached yourself to, and you were confused about Bitcoin from the very beginning. In fact, I have the exact email thread where you ask for help setting up a miner, so careful with your lies.

I'm waiting for someone to release a Bitcoin miner as a worm running on the Intel Management Engine.

Game over for Intel PCs and Core architecture at that point.

Based on their relative prices and market caps, it seems the Bitcoin Core devs have done a better job making BTC valuable and attracting investors compared to BCH devs.
