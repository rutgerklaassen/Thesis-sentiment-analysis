Only caveat I see is if the country experiencing hyperinflation is being sanctioned by the US.

In that case the Stablecoin will be censored or seized from wallets located within that country.

Stablecoins =/ Bearer assets like Bitcoin.

I agree that stablecoins won’t to sick Ethereum and can switch pretty easily. My point is that Ethereum greatly benefits from stablecoins.

The analogy is that if you can build a very useful app for iPhone you can also build an app for Android. But iPhone benefits from your app.

Makes sense. Ethereum as top platform of the moment will be the first testing ground for all middleware.

Stablecoins are Candidate #1 for middleware (read: cross-chain) protocols. There is no Ethereum stickiness at all, and when liquidity maximization is the incentive, they will be in other networks as soon as that makes sense.

And once again, I really like POA , IMHO it's in Top 10 Ethereum ecosystem projects. 

But I also strongly believe that we always need to be realistic if we want to reach our goals. And I'm sure POA will be among the project that will get there.

Any node that is used to send or receive bitcoin influences consensus. You don't need to mine. As 
@Truthcoin
 pointed out, what is the difference between a non-mining node vs. a node that mines very, very slowly? Almost nothing.

All money is tied to ""nothing"". Fiat is tied to confidence in the sovereign which is often fleeting. All stores of value compete game theoretically based on attributes that make for good money. And Bitcoin excels along these attributes.

Ah, yes, well on that we can agree. And that's why Bitcoin turned this gold bug into a Bitcoin maximalist :)

It's time for me to come out of the closet. It's 2018 and we live in an era where one can reveal one's authentic self without fear of judgment or reprisal. Here goes:

I am a Bitcoin maximalist.

There, I said it!

Now, I have to figure out how to tell my parents...
