XRP will 2-3x from here. It’s just a matter of when. I vote a year or two. But it could be a week or two. It’s crypto. All is possible. 2-3x in a year or two will be much worse than the market. Probably worse than bitcoin

I think we benefit from having both pseudonyms and realnyms in Bitcoin, most of my views are just me parroting what pseudonymous Bitcoiners have written over the years.

You have an opportunity here to come off as professional and point out a failure of the Bitcoin Core review process. Instead you're spending your time spreading untrue talking points from r/btc....WHY?! You're just coming off as unprofessional when this should be a win for you.

(1) This isn't just on core devs. There were a lot of eyes on it, we are all to blame. 

(2) Bitcoin's code is the most reviewed in the space, if anything this reinforces the conservative dev approach. Other chains are more vulnerable than bitcoin.

(1) This is why a slow and conservative process is important. Real money at stake, bugs need to be minimized as much as possible.
(2) Great response handling by the devs involved.
(3) Wasn't exploited. Run your own node to verify(http://irunbitcoin.com)
