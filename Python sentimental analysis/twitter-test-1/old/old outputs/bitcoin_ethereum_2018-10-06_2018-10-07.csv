It doesn't matter who has commit access to the bitcoin repo. This is a red herring. Consensus rules define the system, not commit access. It's BIP9 soft forks only from here on out folks and doesn't matter which repo it came from, as long as it follows the rules. t.co/hurhSBIxHb

This is what drives me from the bitcoin maximalism crowd, even though I agree with the btc part. It's this weird logic that on the one hand preaches maximum freedom, but on the other hand criticises people for choosing lifestyles other than their own. It's religious in a sense.

If you believe:

1. Money must be one thing.
2. There are no alt coins with the potential to replace bitcoin.
3. Therefore alt coins are worthless scams heading to zero.

I think it’s obvious, that regarding alt coins, this theory entirely determines portfolio construction?

I do believe patents can stimulate innovation and encourage competition. Just trying to get some clarification as to whether or not nChain patents apply to ABC ALREADY or if it only applies IF Bitcoin has changes from v 0.1 or only IF ABC implements DSV.

Yeah, that's a can of worms there. ultimately it was Bitcoin Core developers that prevented the upgrade in blocksize. Miners wanted bigger blocks and so did most of the users. Core can't allow big blocks b/c that would invalidate their bus. model with lightening. It's messed up
