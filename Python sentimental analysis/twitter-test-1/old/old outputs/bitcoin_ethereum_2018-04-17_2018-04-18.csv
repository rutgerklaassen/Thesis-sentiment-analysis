Good to see another footsoldier join the cult of 
@DanielKrawisz
 and the pre-fork Bitcoin UTXOs  (Sweet band name btw).

Small correction, the correct terminology is ""Blockstream Core"" and don't hesitate to throw ""cult"" at the end of it.

Now, let's come together in chant!

A huge percentage of the UTXO set is simply dust from old spam attacks.  They do not amount to many bitcoin in total, but comprise a huge percentage of the UTXO set.

I would advise simply removing them from a lot of charts/analysis because they are just chaff/noise; don't matter

It's not a question of computing power (though worth noting you can't keep a ras-pi in yr pocket) 

Sending anything more than trivial amounts of BTC will require route with enough liquidity. Hence system will naturally centralise to large bank/ISP style nodes to route payments.

4. Even though you send & receive instantly, most bank transactions are not actually settled for 3 - 5 days. They can usually be disputed up to 2 weeks. That bitcoin transaction is final in 10 mins.
