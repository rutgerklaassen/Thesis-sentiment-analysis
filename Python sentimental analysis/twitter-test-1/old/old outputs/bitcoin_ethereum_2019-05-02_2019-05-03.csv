There are 3 teams working on 3 huge updates at the same time. Split is launching in the next 24-48 hours, http://Moolah.bet launching in about 3 weeks, Exchange 2.0 about July 15. Bitcoin didnt boom for the first 3-5 years. We are only 1 year old. You will be amazed soon

been around since BTC was 75 bucks, just interested in the original Bitcoin and the technology behind it. I also worked on a comparison site, and have been writing about crypto on steemit. I am admin at cryptobriefing but not been active for a while.
I am unbiased in the sense

Fungibility is not a spectrum. It is explicit and literally defined as being exactly equal. Bitcoin in practice is wholly infungible, despite being entirely fungible at the protocol level. UTXOs literally manage the uniqueness of satoshis.

 conf on #blockchains & #cryptocurrency. Great discussions. A question that stands out: ppl trust #bitcoin bec its decentralized, unlike govt. But don't we trust USD bec US is decentralized? It uses separation of power & #democracy. A few thoughts...

Wow nice question. I think i would ask him why he didn't reveal himself ever. Was he afraid of authorities because of silk road? Like Gavin said in the movie: the rise and rise of bitcoin

Then eventually they won't be able to accept Bitcoin at all. Great business decision.

PS For the record I had nothing to do with the decision to withhold information about the open vulnerability. I found out about after the fact. But I support that decision absolutely, just as I support other currency’s (incl. Bitcoin) to handle serious remediations quietly.

Yes. Bitcoin would certainly be banned already, if it was possible to ban it. Just like Egold, or physical gold under Roosvelt. The only reason Bitcoin is not banned, is that it's impossible to ban it. That's the whole point.
