In early-stage Bitcoin, block rewards subsidize network growth & hash rate is a direct function of price. 

In late-stage Bitcoin, hash rate is a function of price AND transaction (tx) volume - which together make up the fees.

This is what they said about altcoins, dapps, smart contracts, and blockchain, with not much to show for it except scams and failed pilot programs, while bitcoin is still dominant and accelerating w/ L2. Tokenized securities will pump, but will also underwhelm with results.

It's only bearish in the short term... and the short term in TA should be considered in terms of weeks, because daily moves are unpredictable. The desire for instant gratification will warp anyone's view of Bitcoin...not to mention the charts.

Yep. And *I think* I agree that bitcoin wins in the end -- if not as the actual unit of account, but as the base store of value into which all other transactions are eventually, in some way or another, settled. But I get nervous being as specific as that.
