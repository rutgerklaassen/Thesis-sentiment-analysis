Example:
Buy $btc at bitstamp for 6350 USD, sell for 6650 USDT at bitfinex
6650USDT * 0,9665 (Kraken) = 6400 USD --> 50$ profit per #bitcoin

USDT/USD is rising slowly... more profit

I don't think you understood the tweet. I am not talking about buying bitcoin and holding it for 5 years, of course it's going to pay off. I am talking about not agreeing with CT saying bull market is basically free money in which everyone wins. It doesn't work like that
