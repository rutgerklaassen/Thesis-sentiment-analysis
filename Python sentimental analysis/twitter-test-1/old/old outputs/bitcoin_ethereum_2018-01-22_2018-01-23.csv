Look, all I'm saying is that you need to distinguish between Bitcoin the ""company"" and Bitcoin the ""stock"". This is now a broken stock. I'm sorry, but it is. In my experience, you need a new story to fix a broken stock.

Ben, the potential flaw in a narrative strategy for cryptoFX is that adoption curve can over time = price curve. So even on genuine adoption, price narrative will dominate on big dumb media. Price narrative could dominate all the way up to $1m/BTC, and you'd miss it.
