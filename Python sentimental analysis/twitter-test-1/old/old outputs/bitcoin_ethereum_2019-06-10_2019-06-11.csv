""the entirety of LNBig currently handles around 200-300 transactions per day""

LNBig provides ~70% of LN liquidity, so I guess we can conclude LN processes ~500 tx/day in total.

With all the marketing & shilling, torches, tipping, Lapps...

Only a handful of those actually own #Bitcoin. I know from direct experience that most of those institutions have no interest in BTC and most think it's going to fade away in the future. BTC isn't some sure thing. 
Don't let the price fool you. It could be a trap/fooling urself.

The reason they are successful is a continued focus on Bitcoin. I would stop attending NY BitDevs if they had speakers who spoke about Monero or Ethereum. This is the “toxic maximalism”. It has nothing to do with turning away newcomers.

I spend a fair amount of time in Nigeria.  There is definitely interest in Bitcoin here although it’s still a small subset of the population.  I feel Nigeria is similar to Brazil; one of those large populations with a broken currency which could hyperbitcoinize rapidly.

Why does it have to be us-vs-them? Why frame it in terms of bitcoin’s foes? How about we instead actually try to get along with each other and build a better future, together?

Embracing toxicity doesn’t help that goal. It instead cements divisions and puts off newcomers.

I do want to underscore that the success of Ethereum isn't completely dependent on Eth2.0 (not to say Eth2.0 isn't important ofc).

But between Eth1.x improvements, innovative layer 2 solutions and existing network effects, Eth1.0 is still a major force to be reckoned with!
