Who are you?

#BTC is #Bitcoin

PSA: viaBTC forked Bitcoin Unlimited Cash in August 2017 to preserve a license-restricted advantage over other miners running the same hardware (ASIC Boost). Hence the timing of the fork.

It would depend on $BTC action. Is Bitcoin going up or correcting?

It also depends on the magnitude and duration of alt season and their marketing.

Personally expecting $400+ for $WTC EOY.

Always DYOR!

Ethereum has a difficulty 'time bomb' that artificially increases difficulty over time. The 'Metropolis' update essentially reseted the time bomb.

That’s true. In fact, it was the Bcash community that came up with it considering everyone who owned Bitcoin was given free Bcash out of thin air. We had just as much right to name it as they did. But really

That's a lie. LN centralizes the whole thing IF it even works. Many hypothetical data models suggest it won't. Again you've not responded to Bitcoin centralization vs DGB, which is an order of magnitude more distributed / safer!
