1/ Over the last 2-3 months, I've been receiving tokens from ICOs I invested in back in Dec/Jan/Feb. They are all rekt. Pegged to ETH/BTC or USD all way down. 

I just received distribution where my group invested $3.5 million at $1000 pegged ETH. Tokens worth $350k, 90% loss.

I've come to the conclusion that this all will just end up with more potential for future forks.

Somehow miners need to agree on what is best for Bitcoin. And although they are competitors they have a shared interest in seeing bitcoin reach its ultimate potential.
