My position remains the same. #Bitcoin will likely be replaced by a new technology & it’s manipulated

It’s possible it’s built to last, but not probable, so keep your position to an amount you’re willing to loose

For most, that’s 1-5% of net worth

It will likely go to 0-$500. twitter.com/cperruna/statu…

Speaking of that, I'm launching a new coin, way better than Bitcoin. ICO soon.

Sure, Bitcoin still counts on many early adopters and enthusiasts...but this is just a phase. If we want to scale bigger we have to realize that this phase will not last forever.

Nah. This has literally zero to do with how Bitcoin should be used. This is just about people. Bitcoin doesn't care.

If you airdrop Bitcoin you don’t need a parachute.

Bitcoin application development, on the other hand, is entirely up to YOU! You can do whatever the hell you like as long as you remain compatible at the protocol level. Build a company, start a github repo, organize events, promote diversity, whatever the hell you want!

It’s the most retarded argument. If he had bought pizza with $40 dollars in his pocket then that, too, should be considered an $80 million mistake as he could vacs otherwise bought bitcoin with it. The purchasing power of the 10K bitcoin *WAS* $40 at the time.

Many users care, they don’t have to, but they do. And it’s part of what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin.
