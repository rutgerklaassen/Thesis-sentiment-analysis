They did it to themselves. If Roger said 'we believe this is better and we'll prove it to you', they would have mostly been left alone. But he attacked bitcoin and tried to convince others his opinion was fact. BCH was a hostile fork from Day 1.

Morgan Creek Digital believes the Digital Asset Index Fund will outperform the S&P 500 over the next 10 years.

$1,000,000 on the line.

Who will take the other side??

Bitcoin uses the secure hash algorithm (SHA-256) crytpographic hash functions. Hence: cryptocurrency..

It's ok if you're not invested in it
It's ok to dislike it. But you should at least try to understand something before you bash it so you don't sound ignorant.

From where I'm standing, Bitcoin as defined by the White Paper and SN is what's been attacked. First by the Core-now-BTC crowd and again by the ABC-now-BCH crowd.

Bitcoin Cash is really the only cryptocurrency I can think of that has been relentlessly attacked since it's inception. Social manipulation attacks (which have never stopped and are intensifying), hash rate attacks, and now legal attacks.

I don't think it should be the coin paying the devs. would you like if each Bitcoin block paid 10% to an address of Satoshi? I wouldn't . Ideally capable devs would be sponsored by the community (both users and businesses etc) - unfortunately I know it doesn't always happen
