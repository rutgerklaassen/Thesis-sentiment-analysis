for sure. if they thought bitcoin would fail they would ignore it. instead, they spend their hours trying to destabilize it with the help of the press, academia, and governments. that shows that they deeply fear and loathe it.

In all the commits I have made to the free open source project called Bitcoin Core (which anyone can fork and customize) I don't ever remember printing myself more money nor requiring that people run my code nor have I jailed any competitors. But perhaps my memory is faulty.

Now with Schnorr and other changes that are coming, the two are becoming even more divergent. The divergence will only increase. You know why? Because one side believes the protocol is complete, and the other believes Satoshi's Bitcoin is insufficient. That's enough to warrant

True. It's sadly a universal tendency, and Bitcoin enthusiasts are not immune to it in spite of the project's libertarian roots.
