Why is BTC lending suddenly a shared pool when all info given says margin traders lend directly from loan offers?  I wasn’t lending clams so why steal my bitcoin?  This is so shonky.  You need to cover this loss from profits, not from peeps making tiny bits of lending interest.

‘No particular link can be established statistically between cash and criminal activities. Cash must not be made the scapegoat. alternative means of payment, such as bitcoin – very popular among cybercriminals – are subject to much less criticism than cash despite the risks...’

Agreed, if Litecoin is the leading indicator then Bitcoin pulling back sub 7000 is likely.

Libra could have traction at first from instant FB users. But overtime, it could fade & shift to Bitcoin as most businesses & people will use a public blockchain that's universal & not specific to only FB. #BSV can absorb these users due to stability, scale & universal feature.
