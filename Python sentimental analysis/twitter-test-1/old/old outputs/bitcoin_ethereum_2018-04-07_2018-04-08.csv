Apr 8, 2018","my naive model (much less effort!): I just compare miner revenue on PoW chains. right now, ETH has a Bitcoin Equivalent Finality quotient of 1.6. So if you want 6-conf BTC-equiv finality for Eth, wait 1h 36m (411 confs)

True or False, Tiffany:

The Lightning Network is not a blockchain, it's an open protocol layer whose transactions are just signed inputs for Bitcoin-locked multi-sig transactions, which are immutable and executed by the Bitcoin blockchain whenever any participant choose to do so

Roger Ver still believes Bcash is real Bitcoin. He has the last node running on Bcash network and lost his wealth by accumulating its total supply. Due to his violent outbursts psych ward stripped him of his yard privileges.

I think what you mean to say is: BTC is BTC, BCH is BCH, LTC is LTC.. That's correct, however, Bitcoin, the p2p electronic cash protocol and network is Bitcoin Cash.  It is not BTC, BTG, BCD, BTCP, etc.

Miners don't have the same costs. When the price of Bitcoin drops, the least efficient miners stop mining and the difficulty drops (or increases more slowly)
