I think a lot of people would be interested in knowing what your thoughts are on the Segwit2X affair now that quite some time has passed. Do you have any regrets? Would you have done anything differently? Did it‚Äôs failure put you off Bitcoin in some way?

I concur with other answers in this thread, which is that no one has actually bothered to sit down and establish a decentralized governance process on Ethereum. And we certainly are at just the early stages of understanding such processes.

This is so poorly phrased I have to disagree with it. Who is we? And what work? It seems like ""The Ethereum Community"" just needs to adopt globally recognized norms around the short list of ways to govern large projects.

Anyone running a full node is a user in this context. I don't have enough fingers to count how many people I know personally who run an Ethereum full node so.... you shouldn't sound so confident in your assertion ""there are no users running ethereum"".

In other words I'm not just asking how Ethereum-mainnet-as-it-exists-today should govern itself; I'm asking the general question, How should a network such as Ethereum, a fork of Ethereum, whatever, govern itself? I've seen zero convincing plans.

This is an incorrect assessment of bitcoin governance. The base layer is ossifying, as any network protocol worth using long term will, but it is still evolving (schnoor, eltoo, neutrino, etc) and layer 2 is evolving at a lightning fast pace.

- Brian wanted control of Bitcoin through S2X. 

- Bitcoiners fought back.

- Brian is now doing everything in his power to divert attention away from Bitcoin.

One can just look at the significant draw downs to know a very significant number of Bitcoin participants are clueless. IF they understood Bitcoin's nature draw downs would be negligible. The worst case would be periods of flatness.
