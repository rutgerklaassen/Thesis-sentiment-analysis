Right now, that Bitcoin is all the forks

If it's not all the forks then it's not an original UTXO set of the original BTC

But I'm just a Cryptomancer, what would I know

Okay lets break it down what Bitcoin is becoming.Bitcoin already best store of value, best medium of exchange (LN) + Liquid Sidechains allows people, companies etc to issue their own digital asset backed by BTC. So BTC will become the new digital asset stockmarket. + ETFs+futures

The beauty is no one can speak for Bitcoin. Doesn't matter if it's the Bitcoin Foundation, Coin Center, or whoever the hell else. It's pissing in the wind.
