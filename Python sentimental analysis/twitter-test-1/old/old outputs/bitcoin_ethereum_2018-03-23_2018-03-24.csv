I have supported the work of the EFF for 25 years. Many people can't make Bitcoin contributions without jumping through hoops.  I have also suggested Paypal support to organizations in the past..  This is not about infighting but maximizing financial support.

Appreciate the kinds words. The COO thing was satire though. Leadership Positions are antithetical to Bitcoin.

All Bitcoiners need to take responsibility and hold themselves accountable in order for Bitcoin to be successful.

Don't trust, verify.

so right Kevin. If you're Bitcoin's CMO, he's the COO. He's committed time, reputation and money to building infrastructure to help many people to get involved.

The world is on fire with entrepreneurs that cannot face the fact that bitcoin exists and they overlooked it. Too many fast buck freddies that want to cash in. This too shall pass quickly once enough people get burned.

PT2. From there, SET became the standard and was developed by 
@Visa

@Mastercard
, with many technology heavyweights of the day: Netscape, 
@IBM

@Microsoft
, 
@VERISIGN
, and 
@RSAsecurity
. It was an umbrella specification that unified several existing proposals.

PT1. It all started with SET IMO. In the mid-‘90s there was a competing approach to the intermediary architecture called the SET architecture. SET provided a way for customers to send credit card information to merchants, without having to enroll with the intermediary.

Bitcoin works fine, no need for fake snake oil garbage like Ethereum funded by banks and tyrants. Try using 
@CounterpartyXCP
 and Bitcoin instead of a fake Cryptocurrency that has no security and no use in the real world.
