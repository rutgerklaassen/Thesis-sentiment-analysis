Also, because Bitcoin doesn't do hard forks, and because Ethereum isn't as well-studied by non-crypto people, the coordination efforts around successful (and unsuccessful) hard forks can seem ""weird."" But this is really par for the course, and not something to be criticized imo.

Ethereum's social contract is also markedly different from many other blockchain projects. Users are bought into the idea that the platform will iterate/move much more quickly than others, and that there will be unforeseen errors along the way.

A very low percent of people trading bitcoin have a clue as to what is actually happening.  Lots comment and are not really paying attention to development in #LightningNetwork .  So most traders know nothing and are watching other traders who know nothing. It's like AMZN at $5

We're in the process of negotiating a research agreement, and that relationship is very much a subject of negotiation, so I can't say too much (both because it isn't defined and because of the sensitive nature of negotiation), but my leaving Ethereum has never been on the table

You're doing it again :) Now it's worse:

- Dandelion is just a networking thing. You can implement it now with Bitcoin if you want. And really the most recommended wallet for Grin is already not using the peer to peer network so what are we even talking about

Are you familiar with bitcoin? On what day did bitcoin become a decentralized cryptocurrency? 

I think you will find that ""decentralization"" doesn't have binary properties.

because it's actually interesting compared to the thousands of bitcoin clones. I think of it as a testbed for cutting edge confidential transaction research.

I don't think it's a Bitcoin competitor because of the linear inflation schedule and the potential for inflation bugs.

Built-in privacy will be a necessity for a truly fungible money. Bitcoin requiring joinmarket, coin control, no address reuse & VPNs etc to be relatively private is a bit like if cash required you to fold each bill into an origami swan for it to preserve your identity.

But again, who's actually using that? And note why the conflation of layers matters...

So we're left with the pedersen commitments, which imo are never coming to bitcoin in their current form. And that's really on the base layer so I'll give you that one
