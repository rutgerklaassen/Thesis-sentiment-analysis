In most cases they also printed the coins for free — so have plenty laying around.

Inflation is one of the greatest causes of income inequality. Bitcoin removes this and also prevents governments from using QE to transfer wealth from the middle class to the elites.

Also, I think Bitcoin is important enough that the Cosmos Hub could offer minting of Atoms to reward miners that participate in the drivechain. Kind of like merge mining, but not exactly. They're processing Cosmos Hub blocks, but not actually producing them.
