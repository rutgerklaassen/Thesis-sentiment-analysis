A few things:

(1) One appeals court ruling in Florida does not legitimize anything.

(2) The ruling doesn't define bitcoin as legal tender, but rather as ""a payment instrument."" Big difference.

(3) The practical effect is that more bitcoin-related conduct is illegal. Not good.

Bitcoin can handle exponential demand, but it has to scale off-chain. At which point it also has to scale on-chain.

It's the exact opposite of ""bullish."" The court held that certain bitcoin transactions can trigger criminal liability for failure to register as a money transmitter. There's nothing positive about this at all.

Increase in adoption = increase in transactions. 

If there's no increase in adoption, there's no need for LN or even bitcoin.

The payment UX of tomorrow won’t be mainstream either.... we need 5-20 years before Bitcoin’s price stabilizes enough to be less volatile than x% of fiat currencies. 

Privacy/non state sanctioned use cases are the make magic moments (PMF) of today/tomorrow.
