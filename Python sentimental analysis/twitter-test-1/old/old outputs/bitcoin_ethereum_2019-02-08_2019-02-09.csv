Also stop using speculation and fear to sell the idea of Bitcoin. It’s dumb and dangerous

 I think I'm getting it. Bitcoin is anti fragile, maybe we should all be attacking for the ""greater Bitcoin good.""

It's good to acknowledge that the trust models are different. People need to know what they're getting into. But I wouldn't call them design failures. Just different. That said Bitcoin is of course the gold standard, no doubt.

So what’s an example of a coin which is mot bitcoin but ok.  Remember its not an equity, so if its Not capable of being money and not a stock, certainly not a bond. What is it. Why should anyone buy it?

Is it OK to drink it, however, if one has just learned that Stanford Hoover Institution economists have drunk/are trying to get others to drink the BitCoin koolaid?
