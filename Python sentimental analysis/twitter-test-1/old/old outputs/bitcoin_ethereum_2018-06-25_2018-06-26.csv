Bitcoin at least has some real clever stuff in it. It's interesting, if impractical. Lightning is ""let's make Venmo work like FIDONet!""

, I'm a big fan from way back, a positive influencer for bitcoin. Thanks. 
I would love your opinion on something regarding governance. Can we DM? or Is there a way for me to reach out in private? I'll keep it brief :-)

Bitcoin will never scale up to facilitate this dream.  Plus it's on the verge of a double spend attack, which will destroy it.  Please read: http://galgitron.net/Post/The-Slow-But-Inevitable-Death-of-Bitcoin…

This GIF makes me want an Office Space remake in which Lawrence introduces Peter, Mike, & Samir to Bitcoin. Their revenge on Initech involves a mining rig in the basement which conveniently catches fire, wrapping up the final act. Milton retires with all the BTC they mined.

Sounds delusional to me. You don’t get all information from r/bitcoin. Twitter, crypto news media; there are plenty of sources. And by now everybody should be informed and bitcoin cash isn’t doing too good. But maybe that’s just my subjective impression.

It's not that there isn't any progress. It's that Bitcoin and Ant Financial are nowhere close to even being in the same league. And for that matter, the latter processes way more payments than PayPal
