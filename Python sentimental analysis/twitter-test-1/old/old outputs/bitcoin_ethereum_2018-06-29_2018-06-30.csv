Will be looking to short again at the top of this wave 4 for one FINAL 5th wave down to 5500ish levels before a major bounce across the entire market

the other alternative is that this wave 4 isn't finished yet and just part of an expanded flat up to my original 6560 area before coming back down to complete the 5th wave.
in order to invalidate this original count we do need to break below 57750 which we have rejected thus far.

Again, the sane answer there isn't to continue criticising Bitcoin, but to make it clear you have no idea how to scale.

This is all giving the public a rather misleading view of reality.

Great read Reverend.  My beliefs are the decoupling will only happen when the manipulators decide to relinquish their control, but not at our unified behest.  Take heart though, a collapsing market is a sign they are exiting Bitcoin, and they'll need new 2.0 coins to invest in

I guess, and I noticed people are a bit hesitant because of the 20 XRP reserve (the reserve is a good thing if you ask me), because they don't understand what to enter in the Destination Tag field, and of course because they heard ""Bitcoin"" 1,000 times and Ripple / XRP ~ twice.
