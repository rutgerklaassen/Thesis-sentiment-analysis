from maza discord rn: 

this is where things like bitcoin and the other big cryptos you see now are going to fail - they're going to fail to reach the indigenous populations, just like the pipeline developers and energy producers and tradtitional (coal, metals, etc) miners have

Think further. 
@Blockstream
 are partners with ICE/NYSE. ICE/NYSE are partering up with microsoft, Starbucks etc..meaning Starbucks will be the first mainstream store that will accept Bitcoin Lightning Payments, most likely in Q1-Q2 in 2019. Its all coming together.

If this whole Bitcoin thing works, then eventually there's not going to be any point to fiat. It will be considered antiquated, like a 1000 page phonebook. Maybe business will stop accepting fiat because it's too volatile. There could be fiat currencies backed by BTC though.

I’m sorry. That sharp, downward turn was awful, for both Bitcoin and XRP. 
One thing that replays often in my mind is that on a long enough timeline, even Mt Gox came out ahead.
