Don't agree! The idea of #Substratum and #Modum is far away from a shit-coin!
But Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin SV, Tron or BTT will survive just because of fake volume and teaming up with Binance? Not fair...

That's a nice thought, however Bitcoin algorithm is designed to avoid inflation, there are a limited amount of Bitcoins so if it reaches adoption, price simply can't be at 1$ because there will only be 21 Million Bitcoin in circulation. People will rather trade Satoshis.

There is a clear conflict of interest between working for a competing chain of ETH 2.0, and ethereum. Besides the parity bug's before constantinople release only make it look worse. It would be best if you worked only for one chain.
