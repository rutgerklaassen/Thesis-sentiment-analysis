Also: Greece is hearing arguments over whether  to extradite another Russian, Alexander Vinnik, to the U.S., France or Russia. U.S. prosecutors allege Vinnik oversaw a bitcoin exchange used to launder money and was used by Russian hackers accused of stealing Democrats’ emails.

If someone lists an app called ""Bitcoin Cash Wallet"" and it's primary function is to buy and store XRP is that okay?

It's not awkward. There's nothing contradictory here. 

If you ninja launch a shitcoin and fuck over dumb retail in the process, I'm going to call that out.

I've never complained about new bitcoin trading options, that would be ridiculous.

Steamboat, look up the reverse of Greshams law: Thiers' law. It is what we would argue applies to Bitcoin given there is no ""govt of the internet"" or for the world. Because of this, bitcoin will thrive online and in international commerce

That's a bit of a mischaracterisation: the point really is that bitcoin's monetary policy is superior, making it scarcer. Making it advantageous for ppl to use it as long term store of value in BTC vs other things. 

Nobody says it'll happen soon, this will take a decade+
