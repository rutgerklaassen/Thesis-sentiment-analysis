It is not a competition between bitcoin and gold, because gold has already lost its own battle: Gold is not even the most valuable precious metal!
I dont say drop gold, cus its f&@ing gold man! 
But at least Bitcoin is number 1 on its own field! :)

With all due respect,

, you really need to study Bitcoin in more depth. It's emerging as a fundamental protocol layer of the internet to store and convey digital value. The corresponding network effects CANNOT be readily copied!

Ethereum would have been much more interesting as an experiment if they did Bitcoin with Turing-complete JavaScript-like scripts instead of the of approach of standalone contracts.

Just like no-one cares about Bitcoin, right? Because by your logic you can do everything with Bitcoin with existing systems too.

You really think, say, a financial institution in China is going to pay another in Thailand with FBCoin?
