Your use of the term ""usage"" is ignorant.

# of outputs remain constant. Batching is a beautiful thing.

Hodling is usage, too. #bitcoin

Scam on your altcoins please.

He has been a joke for a long long time. His predictions are crap and all he does is go backwards, cheery pick instances where his indicators worked and brag about it. He only shills his indicator. Bitcoin is the medium. Only good thing is he is not an outright fraud like Roger.

There are platforms that are designed to be fully compatible with ethereum. If cost of switching (time, money) is less than cost of remaining on ethereum, I expect projects to jump ship to faster and cheaper platforms.

Thanks Jack! Many factors to weigh here. You're absolutely right that #bitcoin isn't inside the system and #WallSt will need to acquire it first before rehypothecation games begin. There are many more avenues for games today than existed in 2003, so hard to weigh relative impacts
