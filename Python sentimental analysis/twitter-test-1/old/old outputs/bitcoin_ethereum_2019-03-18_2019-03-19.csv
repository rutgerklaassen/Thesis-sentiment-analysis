They're not using XLM, I don't care what that title says.  The only thing going on here is those banks are issuing stablecoin IOUs on WW.  Banks could issue stablecoins on Ethereum or even the XRP ledger for that matter.  Doesn't help XLM

For example, is 
@Cosmos
 ""competing"" w/ Ethereum to get adoption of our (in our opinion, better) free & open source tools to build dapps? Yes.

Are we trying to disrupt or detract from the dweb/defi narrative? No.

Are we competing to build a better money token than BTC or ETH? No

you need to consider if bitcoin is at the end of its s-curve of adoption, not the beginning. i don't think enough bitcoiners consider the question ""has everything of interest actually happened?""

bitcoin isn't evolving. its governance is so dysfunctional nothing will change.
