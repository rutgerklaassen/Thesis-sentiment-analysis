 about Ethereum yesterday.  It turns out I should have called upon him to teach others.  As a die-hard Trek fan, I'm proud to have him as part of the Ethereum clan.

Maintaining a fluidly mutable perspective on Unit of Account (fiat vs bitcoin vs Sats) is tough for the nocoiner. This too shall pass.

Descriptive: ""this is the way the world works""
Prescriptive: ""this is the way the world should work""

People think Bitcoin maximalists want to force people to do (or not do) certain things, but really we're just saying how we think the world operates.

It must be said again and again:

Bitcoin maximalism is descriptive, not prescriptive.

We are Bitcoin maximalists because we believe in total freedom in currency competition and accept the realities of monetary network effects.

Here's my arguments:

""Bitcoin consumes too much electricity!""

- then just roduce more!
- open market competiton 
- why do you care? So what? Climate = red herring 
- nothing you can do about it. Get used to it.
- let greed drive innovation to reduce costs (more efficiency)

The reason Bitcoin maximalism is so misunderstood is because too many people think it is prescriptive when it is descriptive (including most of the people in this thread).

All coins are tied to bitcoin. If BTC is up or down the market follows, and the same goes for sideways. All the top coins haven’t budged for a while in this sideways holding pattern. Sadly until TRX or any coin is truly mass adopted with serious use cases bitcoin is king
