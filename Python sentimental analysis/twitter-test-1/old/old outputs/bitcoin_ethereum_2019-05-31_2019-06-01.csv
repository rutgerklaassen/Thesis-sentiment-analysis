Today @DeutscheBank is valued at just over $14 billion and the stock price is in a free fall.

If we could raise the capital, it would be interesting to purchase the failing bank and revive it by embracing Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is never a bearer instrument; people who use it are only signers. Saying it is a ""bearer instrument"" is an analogy, not a description of what it actually does, which a title of a technical paper should be. Literally all Bitcoin users is make signatures and transmit them.
