not necessarily, and especially not if the hedge is intended to be a store of value. a strong negative correlation also implies that bitcoin suffers if traditional asset classes thrive.

In fact these changes have actually been made but haven't gained enough adoption to carry the trademark of Bitcoin hence they are left with changing their name and ticker.

Same goes for Ethereum were attempts to make the monetary policy to be fixed have been made but the lack of adoption has failed to carry the trademark.

However the adoption is not purely democratic and it's largely driven by market dynamics influenced by miners and exchanges.
