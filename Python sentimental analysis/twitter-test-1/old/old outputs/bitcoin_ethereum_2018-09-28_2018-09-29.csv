Just don't trade too much in crypto.  Learn how to HODL and you will do fine in terms of investing.  You should go get yourself the Bitcoin Certified Professional certificate as well.  It is not that hard to past this 75 multiple choice questions.

The question for Monero is different than for Bitcoin. Monero‘s current range proof uses the same security assumptions than Bulletproofs (discrete log is hard) which in fact is a better assumption than the ECDSA assumption. So at least theoretically it has the same security.

My biggest gripe is that Bitcoin isn't fungible. The only cult I want to be a part of is Monero. There is even Skepticism Sunday every week where the community discusses the uncertainties, shortcomings, and concerns anyone may have about Monero.

I had breakfast with Roger Ver last year. He broke my view of Bitcoin Maximalism. I don’t agree with his tactics, but I realized where he was coming from. Showed me he really cared about Bitcoin. Maximalists had my view of him shaped and he was opposite of what they claim.

When dealing with money service business and/or broker dealers, FinCEN kicks in when it comes to KYC & AML, SEC kicks in when dealing with securities or derivatives on securities, the CFTC kicks when dealing with commodity transactions such as swaps/futures (on bitcoin as well).
