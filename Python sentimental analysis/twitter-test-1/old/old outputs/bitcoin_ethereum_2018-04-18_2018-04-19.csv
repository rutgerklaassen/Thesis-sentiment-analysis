Bcash forked with an old client version and became an altcoin, simple as that... Bcash never got the requirements to be the main chain. It's all about consensus and bcash is trash so didn't happen. Sorry, there is only one Bitcoin: BTC.

I like how you cant actually argue the merits of bch, just talk trash about people who know it isnt the real bitcoin. I'm willing to pay $0.20 for the security and reliability btc offers to make tx's. If bch was the real bitcoin, the price and usage would have stayed with it.

Nah, dude.. There are some good explanations for this on r/Bitcoin by head moderator Theymos. Basically, if your BTC are on any wallet other than Bitcoin Core qt (e.g. Coinbase, BitcoinXT) it's an alt coin. 

This is a sarcastic reply.
Real advice: Open your eyes and sell BTC.
