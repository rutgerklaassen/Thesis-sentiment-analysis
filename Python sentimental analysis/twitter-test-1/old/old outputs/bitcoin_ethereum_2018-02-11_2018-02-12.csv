1-Hedging. 
2-Being a bitcoin maximalist and hedging. 
3-100% trust in one of the many brokers who shows up at meetups trying to understand how to by cryptocurrency for their clients.
4-Being self-aware enough to know you may not be ready to secure private keys.
5-Fear of scams.

It's just an ordinary bitcoin tx and the responsibility is entirely on the drive chain itself to maintain its own definition of validity. From the perspective of a full node, you can pretend drivechains don't even exist.

Bitcoin script is at least highly constrained, stateless, and operates on pure functional data structures (UTXOs). Those things alone make it significantly better. DAO-style reentrancy/gas exhaustion bugs are impossible by design.

Sure: “By introducing dangerously large blocks SegWit2x could have lead to miner centralization. This would make physical attacks upon #bitcoin very easy.” 

Although you can also use http://btcThreats.com for a more complete discussion. Just search for “SegWit2x”
