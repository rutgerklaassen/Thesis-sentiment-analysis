Jun 25, 2019","""Smart people"" is overused to the point where it loses its meaning entirely.

If you think there's nothing more outside of Bitcoin then I can say with certainty you're not as smart as you think.

 built a crypto company thru writing despite being non-tech

Some of my smartest friends left crypto 

Their reason are more or less similar: there is little thing interesting in next 3-5 years other than bitcoin, and it’s moving slow, not much they can do, which can’t be a full time job 

(They are not devs so coding is not an option)

I believe you’re wrong.  This bull run will consist of institutional money flowing into Bitcoin.  They will buy the safest and most promising digital asset, Bitcoin.

I remember you palling around with a Holocaust-denying white supremacist and taking $25K in Bitcoin from the same white supremacist who also raised funds for the founder of The Daily Stormer. How's that for a memory, douchebag?

Not worried about what bitcoin does, it's time to scale into $alts boys.

Anything $BTC does right now is peanuts compared to what is coming in the next leg up for $MATIC & #Altcoins. 

One week of #altseason pump will wipeout all the bleeding & make us millions in the process!
