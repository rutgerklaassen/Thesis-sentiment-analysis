It worked.. Why not change the public key format? like $LTC From $BTC?

Wow, that says a lot.

I text myself articles/links when I don’t want to lose them and think they’re very important.

I think it’s time to switch that up and start sending Bitcoin articles and scientific journals to all of my loved ones.

I'm expecting the next Bitcoin then XRP will do a final nose dive and be ready for a nice uptrend. Also it helps sometimes looking at XRP/USD chart and XRP/BTC to see when they align for a run

One of the following is true:

1) The economic activity is obvious.
2) The economic actors make a point to make their activity public.
3) The economic actors don't care about losing the name Bitcoin.
