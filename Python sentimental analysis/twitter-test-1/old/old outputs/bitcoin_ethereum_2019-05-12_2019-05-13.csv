I totally agree.

Bitcoin and Ethereum share similar sets of issues which make mass adoption quite hard - scaling, usability, general UI/UX, lack of true privacy etc.

We'll get there!

#Bitcoin is the 1st digital asset that cannot be counterfeit, and was monetized by free market forces. It depends on an open, global, decentralized network with no central authority that can be attacked, controlled, censored, or corrupted. It is hard money for the digital age.

It‚Äôs a narrative. Usually they fill because bitcoin is a crazy volatile asset and can hit a price multiple times from different directions. 

Is there some sort of pull towards price filling a gap? Sure, but it‚Äôs short lived and it‚Äôs not some industrial grade magnet
