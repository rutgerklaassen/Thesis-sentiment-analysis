With bitcoin you *can't* fork and get the rules you want (or even evolve the rules) unless you're confident you can incentivize enough PoW to keep your chain secure. There are no such restrictions on evolving XRP.

Not true at this stage. It’s not about better, it’s about growth of the network. Better tech doesn’t correlate with larger growth. Many other factors come into play. If bitcoin dies, the whole ecosystem dies until something new gains traction.
