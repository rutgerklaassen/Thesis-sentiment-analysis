Bitcoin can bring power and control back to the people, giving us a chance to opt out of the centrally planned system, at the same time lowering and limiting their power and control. 

The global shift is happening, $BTC is helping usher it in, and both sides might end up..

@connolly_dan
I was just wondering about the next release of Bitcoin SV.

Any idea when it will be available?

Will built-in replay protection be added in this new upcoming release?

Any comments would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!!

The fundamental argument to prioritize for a Bitcoin investor is that the 
Crypto/Blockchain technology has an indisputable capacity to accompany and promote the key issues of our century.

This is a lie. There aren't ""2 versions of Bitcoin"" . There are thousands of altcoins, of which at least 40-ish (BAB, BSV, BTG, BTCP & many others, an almost complete list here:https://forks.net/list/Bitcoin/) used a Bitcoin-UTXO-based airdrop model of distribution.
