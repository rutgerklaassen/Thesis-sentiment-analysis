Bitcoin because it‚Äôs the only coin where I am certain of that it will always be relevant. 
Bitcoin will be there in 3 years.
So it‚Äôs more about safety if I am not allowed to touch it.

Erik, I have built some things. I wrote a couple of best selling computer games and have been a key contributer on many other game projects.

I don't do any projects in crytpocurrency though.

I just use the bitcoin network to protect my wealth. Not turn it over to Jeff Garzik.

If not, then you need to PAY taxes to open a peer to peer channel. 
This is not bitcoin!
