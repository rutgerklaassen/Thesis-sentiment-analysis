It already has.. the market cap doesn‚Äôt agree because #eth obviously is larger but as far as platforms and usage go #trx is already smashing #ethereum in daily transactions and #Dapps 
As these months/years pass it will become very clear that #tron is the new #eth

If a government wanted to shutdown bitcoin they could hijack the seed node IP addresses. It's also possible to stop it on the protocol level if you control the network. Hell, since most mining has consolidated you could just target a few facilities to take it out.

It‚Äôs one of those things that aren‚Äôt intuitive when thinking in terms of block explorers and ‚Äúcoinmarketcap‚Äù sites, but from an engineering perspective makes a lot of sense.

A lot of interesting insights on Bitcoin can be gleaned from its inner workings!

Signal is the most mature *centralized* IM in term of security/privacy, but we also need to move to distributed or at least decentralized/federated models of communications.
You can have a look at Riot or Briar that are a bit less mature, but usable.
