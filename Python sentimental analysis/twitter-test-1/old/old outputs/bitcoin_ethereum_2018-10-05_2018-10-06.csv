It is also objectively false that “no one is [attempting to] build a better Bitcoin” — NANO, ZEC, XMR, etc. are all attempts at displacing BTC in the non-sovereign money use case.

I'm also not particularly moved on the TPS point by the logical fallacy of ""X is a certain way now, thus X will always be that way.""

Not many people think bitcoin scales to ""global reserve currency"" on the base layer, but it doesn't need to if layer 2+ solutions are effective.
