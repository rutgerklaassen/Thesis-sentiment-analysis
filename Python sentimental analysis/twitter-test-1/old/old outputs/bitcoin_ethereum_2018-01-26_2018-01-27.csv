This is a great reason to move to decentralized exchanges.  0x (#ZRX) is creating a platform for decentralized exchanges to run on top of Ethereum and share liquidity.  Great concept that could solve some of the biggest problems in crypto.

Bitcoin blockchain was not involved in the hack tho. Ethereum blockchain has literally been hacked thru the DAO and they had to hard fork just so the guy couldn't keep the  The original Bitcoin has not been hacked and certainly would have been by now with all the other hacks.
