True, what Ethereum did with their ico was wrong and illegal.  But the PoS model on its own isn’t flawed or an automatic red flag for being a security.  That being said, I like the dialogue on this topic and open to being corrected.

Ten years from now it will not matter if you were an OG or NG in 2018 nor if you had bought Bitcoin in 2013 or 2017.

This OG/NG Supremacism is ridiculous and please stop.

Our real enemies are corrupt governments, politicians and banks(and Roger). Stay on target.
