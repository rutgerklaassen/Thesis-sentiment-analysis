I would not be surprised if sometimes in the next months it's uncovered that some bitcoin maxis and bitcoin biased media have spend bitcoin or $ to bash xrp and ripple...like they did before!
Your bitcoin community is just toxic!

If you forgot about  $1400 for 22 years, then you might have also lost your private key? Short the banks/Bitcoin, long the mattress?

People should use hardware wallets for partially signing a transaction of a multisig wallet where the other signatures aren’t in any manner related to the hardware wallet.
People also should stop using the apps that come with their hardware devices.
