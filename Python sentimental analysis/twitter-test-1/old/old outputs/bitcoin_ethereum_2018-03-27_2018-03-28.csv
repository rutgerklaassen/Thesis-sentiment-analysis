The majority of the alt coins only rally when Bitcoin rallies so the bear market will not end until the alt buyers realize that they must buy Bitcoin first or their alts will have no chance of rallying in price.  #BuyBTC

It is unfortunate that bad actors were able to hijack the narrative and transform bitcoin from digital cash to digital gold.  Digital cash is disruptive to powerful players and digital gold is not.
