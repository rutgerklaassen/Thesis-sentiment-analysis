I'm a <insert easiest-to-secure and hardest-to-inflate liquid asset here> maximalist. If something is better than Bitcoin for this, I'll gladly buy it.

Also, I'm fine with other coins existing as a lab even if I would not entrust them with a significant chunk of my wealth.

Actually one of the ways I helped my mom to remember the difference when transferring her Bitcoin was to say ""does Bitcoin have the letter ""H"" in it? then don't send to your BCH wallet"". This did not happen with other tokens on her trezor/coinbase

A bitcoin maximalist believes that network effects in monetary competition means that one good will monopolize as money. There is no single best maximalist investment strategy beyond buying and hodling an amount that doesn't make you lose sleep at night. ""We're all individuals!""
