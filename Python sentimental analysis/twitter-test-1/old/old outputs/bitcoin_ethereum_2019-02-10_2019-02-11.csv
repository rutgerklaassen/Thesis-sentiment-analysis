I'm slightly confused re: the distinction between this milestone, & yr earlier report on the dearth of dApp activity.

It's mainly a terminology thing - are we considering DeFi smart contracts like @MakerDAO ""dApps"", or something else?

Tend to think once we get over some level, probably 6600, buying bitcoin in bigger size starts to get difficult. The 2017 bull run introduced the world to bitcoin, and once people think the bloodbath is over they will dip their toe in the water. It'll be interesting fast.
