Bitcoin is moving from proof of social media to what it was intended, proof of work and miners competing.

Bitcoin is moving forward if you look past the reddit and twitter smokescreen.

Not in inside crypto - not yet anyway. We have only about 3% female participation in Curecoin, and Bitcoin doesn't do much better at around 6%. We've been hopeful that direct participation in cancer, Alzheimer's and infectious disease research can change that. TBD for the moment.

If I run a new version of whatever repo (even Bitcoin Core) that is incompatible with what other people are running (including earlier versions of Bitcoin Core), I get forked off. Not even Bitcoin Core can just introduce an incompatible change without serious repercussions.

 is so well written.. for the demographic that is yet to tap into crypto, baby boomers.

There is honestly no excuse for such an inaccurate discourse if you've done any kind of research on #Bitcoin.

feudal systems existed when there were no alternatives; high exit cost to live in the forest

now: encryption, bitcoin, 3D printed guns, & ability to broadcast videos of state violence (legitimizing reprisal attacks from outsiders); lower exit costs, lower risk/return on coercion

I never understood the logic behind that theory.

""I created this incredibly virulent malware which is rampaging across the internet and telling everyone to send me bitcoin! I should kill it and claim doing so was an accident!""

I think the issue is the article is behind a paywall, so all people see is the headline: ""Goldman Sachs is ditching near-term plans to open a bitcoin trading desk""
