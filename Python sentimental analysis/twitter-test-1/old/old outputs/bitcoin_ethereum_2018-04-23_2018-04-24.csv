Buying flights with $BCH was so awesome.  Broadcast was so fast!!! Almost instant. Bitcoin cash is the future usable today

BCH gets pumped to make more Bitcoin.
Everyone wants more Bitcoin, they just flip BCH for Btc when BCH bottoms out, it pumps, they dump and enjoy their Bitcoin Profits

Any cryptocurrency created for the purpose and used as funding for a project or entity should be deemed a security. That includes Ripple, Ethereum, most ICOs. Arguably DASH. Notably though, not Bitcoin. SEC will have to examine each origin story and launch process in turn

No more than gold coins are ""automatically"" 100% reserve! If bitcoin were sufficiently popular, and authorities allowed it, fractional bitcoin banks would emerge.

Every single #bcash supporter I haven't blocked yet swears the flippening is happening in the next few days and bitcoin is going to zero, along with it's hashrate.  So everyone has a story I guess...
