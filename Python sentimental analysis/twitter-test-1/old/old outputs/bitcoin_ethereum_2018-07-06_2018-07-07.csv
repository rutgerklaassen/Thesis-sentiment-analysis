#Bitcoin as a Store of Value has been trash. Downside volatility is the most important factor as far as SOV goes, and bitcoin's is huge. BTC is down ~70% from its peak. It may take a years to recover. About half investors are down >50% since 2017, and most people got in in 2017.

Right now the Bitcoin inflation rate subsidizes the price/tx to security ratio. Will the steady state result after the blockchain is maintained only on tx fees result in a hashrate large enough to protect against state level actors? I think/hope so.
