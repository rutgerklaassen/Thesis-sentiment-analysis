Wouldn't this just bloat the base layer? Seems like Ethereum aims for absolute minimum features in the base layer, recognizing that many unforeseeable uses might evolve over time.

The best part about the pace of Bitcoin is how quickly nay-sayers like this get to experience their Paul Krugman ""fax machine"" moment. 2 year turnaround on this one - impressive!

Bitcoin Struggles to Break Above $4,000, Analysts Claim BTC Likely to Drop Before Climbing Higher
Analysts expect Bitcoin (BTC) to drop slightly before finding increased buying pressure, which could then help propel it above $4,000.

In the Bitcoin Pre-Release code from November 16, 2008, which was code written BEFORE the white paper was released (October 31, 2008), Satoshi had an early implementation of off-chain payments. 
Lightning solves flaws in Satoshi's early implementation. 
He really was a visionary!

There's a hidden assumption in the above; that Bitcoin can just survive if no one does anything to defend it, and if it doesn't survive it was inevitable it would fail anyway.

Ostracism is a powerful way of maintaining the integrity of a community imo

Bitcoin's community is its immune system. Businesses that attack #Bitcoin should face business repercussions while those that support Bitcoin should be rewarded. #neverforget twitter.com/jack/status/10‚Ä¶

You should check it out. It's very very interesting. There are great resources here. Start with the first post under ""Getting Started"", if you're brand new to Bitcoin. There are a lot of helpful people to answer questions on Twitter, too!
