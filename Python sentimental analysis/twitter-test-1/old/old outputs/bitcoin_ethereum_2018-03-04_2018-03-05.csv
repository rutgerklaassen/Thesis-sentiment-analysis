Got out of grad school with 3 degrees and working in my field at 50 hours a week. When I heard about bitcoin and blockchain from an episode of RadioLab in 2014. I dove right in and haven't surfaced since. It's not a lack of time it's a lack of fortitude and determination.

Altcoins are priced in satoshis (fractions of a bitcoin) so 
a) when BTC rises, even if alts stay the same in USD terms they're down against BTC and 
b) when people think bitcoin is going to go up, they sell their alts to get more bitcoin.
