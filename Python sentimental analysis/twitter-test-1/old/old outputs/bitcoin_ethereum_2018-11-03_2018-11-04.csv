Who's they? Bitcoin maximalists? YouTube teenagers? Give me a break.  If XRP continues to penetrate the global banking industry, 100B XRPs won't begin to be enough.  You can't use Bitcoin as any metric whatsoever for what XRP will amount to.  Bitcoin ended where it started, a fad

It‚Äôs because Bitcoin used to be the only game in town. Now it represents half the crypto market cap. A lot of incoming fiat is going elsewhere hence Bitcoin‚Äôs future is less predictable.
