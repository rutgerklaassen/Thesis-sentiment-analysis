 Making up / not denying story about having $7M in Bitcoin & having to admit it in court because Rick Ross' ex-gf is suing him. Dude hitting rock bottom. Sad.

Buy the drip if you are smart. BTG with its use case is $119
You seriously think BTCP has no use case? this is a first bitcoin private coin. These opportunities don't come often.

Say I want to send $60 to my pal Captain Disingenous in Grenada:

1. PayPal/Western Union/etc, via Visa. ~3-5% fees, it's there in seconds.
2. Bitcoin etc; I have to: Fund an exchange acct, buy crypto with fiat, send to El Capitain, he cashes out, 5h and $20 USD in fees later

We'd love to invest in bitcoin, Brenda, but some of us have to make rent, get groceries and/or pay for tuition. Parents cutting you off by the time you graduate? More like working to make graduation and providing for your family at the same time. Ughhh.

Bitcoin reimplements the accounting ledger so that it's quick reconciling, global, and trustless. How you think that is ""for no broader benefit"" escapes me. 

The ""increasing resource constraint"" bit is also mystifying but that's another discussion.

I'm not an elected official, and I don't represent anyone other than myself. Since when did I become the CEO of Bitcoin all of a sudden? http://Bitcoin.org is NOT the official website of Bitcoin, you are assigning too much importance to me.

I wholeheartedly agree. I was laid up in the hospital almost 3 weeks last year and almost died. I treasured each and every ""we're praying for you"" and ""keeping you in our thoughts"" that I received.

If I may : govt procurement process / tenders (like the govt of canada is using) I believe it is ethereum based. Also supply chain tracking of goods and services, think organic food from  our Okanagan Valley.
