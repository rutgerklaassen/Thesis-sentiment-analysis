Holding Bitcoin is using it, Peter :)

It is a scarce, capped supply asset that will continue to appreciate in price (store of value) as demand increases. Don't get distracted by short-term volatility.

Grant, Twitter is a cesspool of scammers and sock puppets funded by big VC money. 

Ask Craig to do a bitcoin key signing for you. He has signed for the sake of business partnerships many times, but his enemies criticize them because he want so a public signing for them.

It's basically insanity that there's even an argument about bitcoin tbh. I understand volatility is a valid point. Regardless, there simply isn't a more efficient way to transfer value. I live a borderless life, so for me traditional finance is such a headache to deal with.
