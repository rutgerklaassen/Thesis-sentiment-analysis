5. How is PoS internally validated but PoW isn't? Why does is even matter? Bitcoin miners are rewarded in BTC and some likely hold it. If anything, PoS may align validator and holder/user interests more closely (potentially a good thing).

People in the legacy markets do not understand bitcoin.  Even people who own it but store it on exchanges and don't control their own private keys do not understand Bitcoin. Then comes the rest of us, and frankly we don't really fully understand Bitcoin and its power.

Well, you aren't the only one concerned.  However, an attack on the bitcoin network would be a bit of a MAD situation (mutually assured destruction).  If they play nice, then they get to keep making money.  If they don't, we will be forced to execute a POW and restart the network
