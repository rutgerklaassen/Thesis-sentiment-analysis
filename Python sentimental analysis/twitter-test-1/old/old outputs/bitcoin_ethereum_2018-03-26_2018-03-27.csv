Thursday I have some shares I sold of GBTC (get the middle man out the way) that will clear and I am going to put 75% on bitcoin & 25% on Litecoin. Not buying anything else. Just those two. So, I‚Äôm trying. Now that I understand blockchain tech, I feel better about investing in it

Twitter's new policy regarding #crypto advertising is lacking. If they're truly serious about addressing potentially misleading/deceptive marketing practices, why is #bcash permitted to openly misrepresent itself with the #bitcoin handle on this platform?

Dear @twitter: 

One of the most prominent #crypto accounts on your platform misrepresents itself by the #bitcoin name while promoting #bitcoincash.

Your new initiative against possibly deceptive marketing necessitates that you weigh the consumer protection implications of this. https://twitter.com/crypto/status/978322374352429056‚Ä¶

I'm sorry, but I'm not going to see the ""Bcrash is the real bitcoin satoshi vision conference"". Rather than talk through videos, you are more the welcome to join whalepool ts and have some conversation.

computer crash had nothing to do with it, user did a naive backup and restored to that, if your computer crashes, for fault tolerant node it's no issue

we have a complete static+dynamic back up scheme planned, will touch on a bit at my talk tonight at SF bitcoin devs

Some analysts seem to have missed the fact that both companies made a lot more money on crypto after Bitcoin moved on to the ASIC stage.

I guess ETH wasn't quite as resistant to ASIC as thought, but the next one might be.  And that's the point, there will be a next coin.
