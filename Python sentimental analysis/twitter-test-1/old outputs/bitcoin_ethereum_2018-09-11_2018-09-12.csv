I agree cryptocurrency distribution models in general could be much better. I would not say ethereum's is more unfair than others. It may even be one of the more balanced due to the multi-component approach (sale, premine between ~100 developers, mining).

He's right on one thing, the current stable of altcoins won't come back. Vitalik's quote was ""crypto"" markets, I believe that to be the case. Bitcoin though will continue as usual.
