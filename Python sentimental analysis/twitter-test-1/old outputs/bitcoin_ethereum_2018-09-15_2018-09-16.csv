@lrettig
, I've started gathering Typescript and Ethereum related tools as https://github.com/ethereum-ts org on Github. I wonder if Ethereum Foundation would be interested in supporting it, I've seen your work on assembly script and thought that you're the guy that could help me.

Did you read the indictment cited on the Wiki page? The government thinks Mr. Hutchins created and sold a banking trojan that was used to compromise at least 10 ""protected"" computers. Tried to hide the transaction by using Bitcoin.

Agreed. But I think with bitcoin (or crypto more broadly), ""Lindy Effect"" is a nice wrapper for observation that a major hurdle to adoption is simply familiarity; ie, once ppl get used to digital scarcity, they're far more likely to adopt. Thus as time goes by, p(longevity) rises

@EthereumClassic

My focus was on cpp-ethereum but I also looked at the other codebases at time.

There is still no Ethereum codebase shippable on iOS because of (L)GPL incompatibility with the App Store.

I disagree with this. Bitcoin should build features that help users resist confiscation and censorship earlier, such as decentralization and privacy/fungibility, which governments and compliant big business tend to dislike.

My point here isn't to not own crypto or Bitcoin btw. It's that so few people should actually be or succeed as currency traders and most people should just index. Index funds will ultimately own any of the impt crypto stuff too. Why risk your retirement?
