To be fair, bitcoin won’t be used by the masses for payments until it is cheaper, easier, better, faster and more reliable than the alternatives. That will happen but until then, the only reason for most of us to use it is to learn about it.

“Bitcoin bubbles” aren’t a thing. This is an emerging asset class and of course it is going through natural fits and starts. 
Crypto is basically zero in the scheme of the $300T capital markets. 
The Credit Cycle is all that matters for Risk assets.
