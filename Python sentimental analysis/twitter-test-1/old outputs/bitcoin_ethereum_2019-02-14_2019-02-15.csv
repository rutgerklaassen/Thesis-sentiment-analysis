Why not hold it till the end and let our grandsons inherit our keys. Do we sell our property or gold in 2022? then why sell bitcoin alone when we were trained to ""Value our wealth in #bitcoin""

If I was Polkadot I‚Äôd want to get as much Ethereum comparison debate going so I can justify my valuation during the raise I‚Äôm trying to close.

I wasn‚Äôt talking about that.

My concern is we have to start developing ASAP Bitcoin tools that DO NOT require any previous Bitcoin knowledge so any business or government can implement them for running a supply chain, criminal records, etc.

International standard has arrived. It is borderless, permissionless, trustless, censorship resistant, inflation resistant, globally neutral, globally valued and globally traded.
It is called Bitcoin.

100%, in fact moreso because 'today' China can unilaterally decide to destroy Bitcoin by ordering its 9 mining pools to double-spend attack Bitcoin, and nobody would know till it's too late.  Whereas the XRP ledger is completely decentralized and no single authority can affect it

No but to refer to $BSV as Bitcoin would be fair in my opinion. The vision is great the team are capable of delivering. This is Bitcoin at its best, fully functional groundbreaking tech and sound money all in one.

This betrays a deep misunderstanding of monetary competition (hint, victory is all about hardness aka credibility of monetary policy) - #bitcoin is superior and will continue to outcompete.

They're basically giving blockchain technology their approval and bringing legitimacy (in the eyes of normies) to cryptocurrency in general.

How can anybody think this is bearish? JP Morgan coin is not competition to #Bitcoin.
