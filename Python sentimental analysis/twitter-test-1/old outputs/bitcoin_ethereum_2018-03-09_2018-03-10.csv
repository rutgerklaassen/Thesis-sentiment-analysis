The majority of currencies in existance are ERC20 tokens, basically Ethereum, since it is a developer platform, not meant to be a currency primarily. And there's a lot of good products out there on ETH, like Simple Token, FunFair etc.

Even if you want to make the MOE argument, ETH will be used more than BTC as an MOE within the Ethereum ecosystem.

BTCs chances rely on “proof of marketing work”. 

So probabilistically, I assign a higher probability to an SC coin winning SOV long-term.

So do you think bitcoin is broken?

And you think shaking up the hardware investors even more will fix it?

You aren't thinking this through.

Your best move at this point would be to load up on BCH, seize http://bitcoin.org (you pay the bills) use it for BCH & pow fork BTC
