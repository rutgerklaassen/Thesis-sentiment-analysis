The BTC mempool is now over 46MB meaning it will take roughly 8 hours for payments to settle.

The available reward for the backlog is only 0.49BTC, meaning the overall reward for mining blocks during high traffic periods (more resources) is lower. 

The economics are broken.

Average monthly wage in Venezuela is ~$5. The average Venezuelan can't afford to transact in BTC.

Every week I see another article saying Bitcoin uses ""encryption"". No one told the authors that. It was just assumed, because what Internet currency wouldn't?

Strictly as an aside to the question of ""enough decentralization"".

Bitcoin doesn't have a leadership structure, that's what makes it different from Altcoins (inc BCH)

There are no leaders that can force hard forks & changes like with BCH.

There are still 10-15% of nodes that are out of consensus from the last poorly designed fork to 32 MB.
