My wish list: auto buys, option to display in sats, sats back boost, bitcoin deposits(would essentially allow you to fund the cash card and spend anywhere Visa is accepted), spend bitcoin at opt-in square merchants with no conversion.

Buy & Hold XRP & never sell it all! When #XRP reaches a high value you'll withdrawal over a lifetime as you do with a pension or savings. 

You don't want to be that person who sold their #Bitcoin when it hit $100 in 2013. Oops, that must of hurt! 

Something to think about!

In layman's terms it ""encapsulates"" the oracle protocol from its environment. The #chainlink network will carry no dependency on #ethereum internals when evaluating a request. It will only depend on #ethereum to store a result. A big step for a ""modular"" #4IR and interoperability
