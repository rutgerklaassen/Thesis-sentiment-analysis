Technically, the original blockchain is dormant.

Bitcoin Cash did a hard fork, and Bitcoin (SegWit) did a soft fork, and no-one maintains the chain with the original rules prior to these forks.

This is correct, but it was the Bitcoin Cash hard fork that did this, not the SegWit fork as implied by the current wording.

Won't be surprised if it goes up regardless, history of going up big when bitcoin and ether break major trends, it bounced off of ether bottom and flipped 4H PSAR against USD, BTC and daily against BTC. Also the 4H MA crossover bullish. A lot of good there.

Xrp has pretty good chances to become first global accepted crypto asset (currency). Bitcoin has problems with obscurity of protocol and centralization. LN is just patch on a broken system and it won't heal it, not in the real sense. The rest is just dust in the wind.

Talk about revisionist history. The authors are negligent in their failure to mention that #Bcash deployed a difficulty reset specifically designed to leech hashrate from #Bitcoin. Bcash is not backward compatible, nor is it the most valid PoW chain. Bcash is an altcoin at best.

That's what everyone said about bitcoin and they were all wrong for precisely the same reason. Value and utility don't create themselves by magic. In any event, if you think what Ripple is trying to do is easy with bank support, you should expect us to succeed.
