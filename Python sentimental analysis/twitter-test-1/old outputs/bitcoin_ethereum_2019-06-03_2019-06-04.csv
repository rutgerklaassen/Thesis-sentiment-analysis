Kyle, you’re trying way too hard to shit on Ethereum. It’s getting a bit sad.

 wants Utility. Real utility. Yes, #Bitcoin has utility but not in the eyes of Buffett. He's a banking guy that doesn't care for the evolution of money.

-He will understand Justin's plan for blockchain technology; which is what Buffett likes.

Seconded. Keeping pace with bitcoin's furious merge velocity is a full time job though.

I think the market will decide this, not you or I, and confusion will reign. We're going to get another chain for securities (probably many) whether we like it or not. Liquid/Elements is one. Assets on top of bitcoin destroy it's incentive structure. Market cap of S&P 500 > gold.

Not necessarily. Other crypto tech could still be important without the market cap of their coins rivaling Bitcoin’s.

In the block size wars of 2017 they had their first major update in years, rebasing against a more recent version of Bitcoin and deploying segwit. This was a marketing tactic for segwit (and LTC), but a wise move. It's not supposed to be a testnet though it could be used that way

Once you start pulling out warrants you get to track and unravel all the larger networks tied to these perpetrators.

That's why I told the 
@FBI
 about how vulnerable they were at the same time I went into bitcoin and botnets, Tor and embarrassingly parallel problems. Sept, 2017.

Agree with exception of ""no to low yield"". It won't yield in bitcoin terms, but will yield in real terms.

If supply stays fixed and economy grows, the value of one satoshi increases with the size of the economy. Of course this assumes absolute mooning, which may not happen ..
