You guys set the rules if I remember correctly. First bcashers claimed the longest chain with most cumulative work is the real bitcoin! You lost. Then when your EDA was exploited it was “most current hashpower is the real bitcoin!”. You lost. Ur so far behind you think ur ahead.

Yes, my prediction from February was wrong and invalidated. 

Things change a lot in trading and doubly so in Bitcoin. A lot has happened, both onchain and technically, since then. 

We will be delving into it tomorrow on the show.

Satoshi Nakamoto is a humanoid robot returned back from the future to alert humans about Skynet . So he invented bitcoin, this way Slynet is too busy mining bitcoin and this will reduce cpu availability to overtake the world. Simple as that.

The path to hyperbitcoinization is through the credit/debt markets. Bitcoin will end those and ultimately fiat which is created by credit.

This post explains why reorgs are wonderful:
