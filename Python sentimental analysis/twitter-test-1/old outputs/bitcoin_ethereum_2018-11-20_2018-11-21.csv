Remember #bitcoin? If you bought a year ago you've lost ~70% of your money.

Oh yeah, the SEC is forcing #ICOs to refile, pay fines and give the money back..... which is *exactly* what the adults in the room said would happen. 

#Crypto heads, what are the signs of hope?

Bitcoin started with 1MB.

We should have been at 1GB by now.

What a difference that would have made.

Thank you so much Blockstream, Core, Greg, Luke, and the rest of the gang.

How often do we hear people say they can not afford Bitcoin. #UnitBias  maybe bitcoin ought to be priced in other units MiliBitcoin, mBTC, or Satoshis, or MicroBitcoin  uBTC.  Too many people think they must buy a whole bitcoin like a share of stock.

Many ledgers with good fit for purpose will need a coordinating root chain or you have a balkanized slag heap of race hazards on databases slathered in ""blockchain"" sauce. Ethereum is simply, in my own judgment - for what it's worth - the most likely option for root chain

Question: hypothetically speaking, what do you think would happen if rooting DPKI operations in a system that represented the largest, mainstream, world-scale use of a public blockchain in history, required Bitcoin to operate? Just hypothetically, of course.
