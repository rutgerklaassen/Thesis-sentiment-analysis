They ‚Äúgleefully‚Äù used it bc they had no other option. The ability to opt-out of the system via Bitcoin has enormous consequences for governments. If a majority of the population opts out of gov fiat, then ultimately that will end up in that local governance/monetary policy.

I‚Äôd argue that the ‚Äútraits‚Äù Bitcoin has as a SoV are far superior than previous SoVs that are used to opt out. We‚Äôve never seen anything like this before. History rhymes bc human behavior/motivation stays somewhat constant. Bitcoin plays strongly into those motivations.

Bitcoin is resilient and antifragile.
Heres a fact: Both SV and ABC roadmaps work towards global cash. The disagreement is on the path.

Either side that wins trumps BTC choked chain.
