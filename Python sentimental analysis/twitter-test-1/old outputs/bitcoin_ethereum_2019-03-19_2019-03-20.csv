That's beyond moronic. Any commodity (or basket of commodities) you choose would incentivize producers of those commodities to simply create more.

The most scarce thing on earth, and hence the best form of money, was gold. That is, until bitcoin was invented.

Premining is a loaded term with artificial boundaries.  The subtext is that someone accumulated in isolation prior to public exposure.  Ripple did this, but so did Satoshi (1 million bitcoins), and pretty much every other coin.  Saying Bitcoin wasn't premined isn't honest

2/2 #DeFi lets people opt out of the situation you describe above (as does Bitcoin), and also lets people opt-in to a new, more transparent, more accessible financial system. 

E.g: Want to hold you money in dollars, but not carry bank counterparty risk? Use DeFi (not Bitcoin)

This was in reference to the network and consensus mechanisms. Right now, just 5 mining pools control decisions for Bitcoin. There are diminishing benefits as the number scales, however. I would argue that 41,000 is not meaningfully different than 4,500. But 5 is simply too few.

I think you need to ask separate questions for separate aspects to get an accurate assessment... the network infrastructure, the consensus mechanisms, the development, etc. By design, some aspects are more centralized and some are less centralized than Bitcoin.

For those just joining, the pres is trying to make the irrelevant point that ‚ÄúSegwit coins aren‚Äôt chains of signatures‚Äù (hence not the whitepaper‚Äòs definition of bitcoin, as if that matters), as miners won‚Äôt fetch sigs, as they have no value. Which is absurd, see previous reply.
