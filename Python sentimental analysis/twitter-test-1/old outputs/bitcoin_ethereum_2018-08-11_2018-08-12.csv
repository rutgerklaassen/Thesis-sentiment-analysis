I sell only when I need money. It doesn't matter whether you bought Bitcoin this year at $18,000 or at $6,000. 28 months later you are a winner. Never think of what you could have made. Consider only what you are making. There is no bad time to buy decent cryptocurrency.

In the last Bitcoin bubble, the price dropped 83.3% from 1,200 to $200. It‚Äôs reasonable to expect that it will drop about 80% in this cycle. This would be a drop from $20,000 to $4,000.
