In business: take on only employees you are sure they are the best. Trust only people who deserve it. Decline jobs that just promise to be profitable.
In private: Buy as many Bitcoin as you can get, sell everything in 12.2018, take the billion and buy an island in the sun.

It's good Twitter puts ""Twitter for iPhone"" at the bottom of their replies so I know who on Bitcoin Twitter is completely against open-source, and loves walled gardens.

stop saying ""capacity"" in USD terms.  Bitcoin price fluctuates relative to BTC.  It matters more how many BTC are in the network.  Not USD value

I think the confirmation that a Bitcoin ETF was formally approved could trigger a pretty significant rush to the market, and this boost the price in anticipation of the market activating, but then it would drop down to a rough price equilibrium range. Don’t underestimate hype

To clarify: I do work on some altcoins privately for pay (since I can't make a living off working on Bitcoin), but I assume you aren't talking about that.

moving your whole stack to a hardware wallet as your first go.  Ideally you should start small, lock yourself out of the wallet, use a backup seed, send bitcoin to places - then repeat 5 times and probably make a mistake and lose few satoshis.  

THEN you send your main stash.

This topic comes up often at our local bitcoin meetup. If you want to make a living doing bitcoin stuff, it's very tough if you're not shitcoin-flexible.

Start by reading up on basics. Then from there on go deeper. Lots of resources on the internet.

The best one imo: https://lopp.net/bitcoin.html

And when it comes to price, Bitcoin is massively undervalued.

I think this whole thread is counter productive. Most ppl don’t care if companies support alts. And the ones who do, do their own research.

Maybe the energy is better used by educating folks about Bitcoin and why most alts are just affinity scams.

Expecially if the CEO, when criticized for that, instead of an honest ""yeah, you know, we tell clients it's nuts, but it's easy money, that picture was just marketing department screwing up"", start pulling crazy Coinbase-style ""you don't know how important I am for Bitcoin"" shit.

This might be feature, not a bug. Bitcoin is not a corporate, money driven project. It is largely driven by idealism, pure cypherpunk ethos and people making sacrifices because they feel it's right. Money corrupts, in different ways. I do however understand that devs need food :)
