The Internet gave us the tools to communicate and share information amongst each other in real-time. Bitcoin will give us the tools to communicate value amongst each other in real-time.

That's why Bitcoin is true money with scarcity. Same goes for gold or any other real asset.

There is bitcoin, and then there are forks. Anyone can copy the code and create a fork but this DOESN'T copy the users, the network effect, the miners, the full nodes, the second layer, the tools, the integrations, or anything else. Photocopy a bar of gold as much as you like..

Can someone correct me if I am wrong but isn`t this a bad thing in the long run? Sure scarcity is an important part of sound money, but so is longevity. If bitcoin gets too scarce could it not lose its salability? 
Would love to hear opinions on this. Thanks!

An estimate is around four million.  Bitcoin is a black hole, accreting ever more while sublimating away (Hawking radiation) through private key loss.

Which regulator would control the internet (and the internet money)? China, Europe, US, UK, Russia??? 

Regulators wont stop bad business practices resulting in customer loses.

The rules for bitcoin are in the code - we trust the code more than any 1 - 10 regulatory agencies.

eyerolls and downright dismissal from anyone I talk to.  Like, literally everyone.  Even the most risk tolerant won’t listen about #bitcoin.

But to me, the 99% are being risky...complacently accepting the status quo.

I wonder when this will switch

No, not at all. Bitcoin can be further subdivided below the satoshi unit. The unit is arbitrary. The price adjusts to fit the economy in the number of total units.

Actually what worries is that bitcoin-core may become too like like Linux, which has some early privileged leaders that are funded, a growing technical debt, and barriers of entry for new developers to sustainable livelihoods without employment by big corps with control agendas.
