Already out of arguments? Does aion even have a connector to another DLT already? $QNT has connectors for bitcoin, ethereum, hyperledger, ripple, quorum and iota. Moreover, multi chain applications built on overledger will not be single-ledger dependent like those on $aion

i think the price is not real. There is OTC, and there is also the question of CMC. CMC said they arent reporting SBIVCs volume because the API wasnt activated. Is this the case with DMM BITCOIN, and all the others as well? I dont have the answers, but i think price is higher.

Craig Wright on Bitcoin Cash Fork: 'We Will Bleed Them' - Decrypt
Wright says ABC will lose the Bitcoin Cash hard fork war. If the brass balls on his desk are anything to go by, he will see the network collapse to win.

Not incorrect. The report is referring to different forks. Bitcoin SV is _also_ forking from Bitcoin ABC. There is no replay protection for that.

There _is_ replay protection for the hard fork of Bitcoin ABC with CTOR and Bitcoin ABC without CTOR, that gets enabled automatically -
