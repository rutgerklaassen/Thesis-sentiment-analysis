I would argue that fractals aren‚Äôt a very good indicator, simply because the fundamentals that existed in 2014 are different than they are at present time. #Bitcoin is now a household name, and it definitely wasn‚Äôt in 2014.

This is a retarted statement from someone who clearly has no frickin idea what is happening. Bitcoin is decentralized open source software. It's use case is censorship resistance immutable money. This will play out like TCP/IP, not music file sharing!

When you compare something to something else because it has similar functions/properties/abilities.  Not comparing Bitcoins Decentralized nature, he is comparing their role in the disruption and evolution of their respective industries. And it's a very Apt analogy.

same example for bitcoin: if you want to trade and speculate, its hard to believe you would deliberately buy BTC now for 7350$ and sell it for 6000$ - you wouldnt last long if you would do that repeatedly anyway as it would drain your funds right?

It‚Äòs funny that this topic is discussed today. Didn‚Äòt they learn how this works? Bubble pops, they try to ruin bitcoin with FUD all over the news, declare it as dead for the 500th time, bitcoin surges to new highs, bubble pops,...

Wonder when they‚Äòll learn it

If your node generate blocks, you are participating in the game.

If your node doesn't generate blocks, you are a spectator. There is nothing wrong with being a spectator.

Most of us will be spectators. Bitcoin is not like orienteering.

Only contributing to Proof of Work counts as contributing to consensus. 

A RaspPi is insufficient compared to the ASIC behemoths today. 

Observer nodes being worth anything are a circlejerk fallacy to deceive the ignorant. 

This is the basis of Bitcoin. Lying won't change it.
