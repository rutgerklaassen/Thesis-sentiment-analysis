Why isn't Ryan being accused of maximalism, tribalism, and unhelpful zero-sum game thinking?? He said he thought Polkadot was the best, he showed ETH projects moving to Polkadot, and he encouraged the people at the Ethereum conference to instead build on Ethereum.

For some reason people have decided its fine for Polkadot to go to Ethereum events and explicitly say people should leave inferior Ethereum for superior Polkadot, but if Ethereum supporters question this *they* are attacked for maximalism, tribalism, and zero-sum thinking.

3/ An Ethereum full node (non-archive) is equivalent to a Bitcoin full node as it stores the full blockchain data available on disk and can serve the network with any data on request. It also receives new transactions and blocks while participating in block validation.

The bandscope clearly shows a frequency *offset* of 2000 Hz with a wavelength of 20m. And bitcoin lightning invoices don't use encryption. You don't know anything about radio nor bitcoin.

4/ Once an Ethereum full node is fully synced it stores all state moving forward similar to archive nodes.
