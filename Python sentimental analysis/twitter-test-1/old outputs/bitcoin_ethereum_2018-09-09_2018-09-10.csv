I should add, this is precisely why I'm changing every penny I can of U.S. currency for Bitcoin and burying it deep on the Bitcoin blockchain where the U.S. government can never use it to fund another war.

Fake ""Bitcoin gurus"" who can amass a huge twitter following will have developed a licence to print money if just a small percentage hang on their every word. Don't get sucked into being one of the small percentages. Understand time preference (Read The Bitcoin Standard) and HODL

Apples and oranges.  Bitcoin is a currency that's actually being used.  A hole in the street?  Not so much.

But nice try.  Next time, choose better analogies.

What you’ve done is literally restate my argument back to me and then say I’m wrong! 

You are 100% correct that Bitcoin is not the same thing is a random hole in the ground — which is exactly why it’s value comes not from labor, but from something else ;)

It’s not clear to me (

 pointed this out) why the XBT product is impacted and GBTC isn’t. It’d be great if regulators let the market freely decide what to trade... allow ETFs, ETNs, closed-end funds,etc...Bitcoin is already widely available to investors of all kinds!

If you have questions about Bitcoin, do you recommend shouting them at Coinbase employees every time they make a company announcement on Twitter?
That’s the logic being used here and I don’t have a lot of patience to entertain it.

Okay... and 9 years after Bitcoin's launch there's an estimated 20mil users, most of which just own BTC on a centralized exchange. This doesn't compare well with your chart.

I debate ideas, not people. You've posted content I agree with before and content of which I'm skeptical.

My point was the other apps demonstrated clear product-market fit by rapid adoption. BTC has yet to do this, although I agree on the problems bitcoin was created to solve.
