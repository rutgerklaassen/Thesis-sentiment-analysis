Neither Core nor Cash are “Bitcoin”. Bitcoin Core is a client implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, while “Bitcoin Cash” or simply Bcash, is an altcoin being promoted fraudulently as an impostor of “Bitcoin”. This was already settled nine months ago.

He is not mining Bitcoin.  He is mining Ethereum and probably Monero that then he probably exchanges for Bitcoin.  It has not been possible to mine Bitcoin with a GPU in around 5 years now. Bitcoin Mining is ASIC-only.

More generally, the argument put forth is akin to saying that different dialects are different languages.

Different dialects _can_ evolve into different languages (Bcash), but as long as everyone understands each other (Core/Libbitcoin/etc.) it is the same language (Bitcoin).
