IMO,

 deserves some blame for promoting #Bitmain's altcoin (#Bcash), as the ""real"" #Bitcoin.  However, the tsunami of shitcoins unleashed by #Ethereum has done more damage.   We may have begun a needed purge of the space from which #BTC will arise stronger than ever.

""The fall brought the total value of all Bitcoin in existence to below $87bn"" really highlights the problem... Because it assumes theres $87bn out there that people would pay for it. And as its crashing down, clearly that's not the case.

You're completely right in that it's hard to compare Ethereum to traditional businesses.

That said, Ethereum was built to eliminate rent extraction, it's a complete paradigm shift, a new business model. Revenue, rent and profit are not relevant anymore. Pretty mind-bogging..

The mapping of an identity to a public key doesn't need to be public in order to be functional. Bitcoin is economic 'glue' that gives a measure of confidence that a particular key will continue to map to an ID as long as it has a balance suitable for a certain amount of risk
