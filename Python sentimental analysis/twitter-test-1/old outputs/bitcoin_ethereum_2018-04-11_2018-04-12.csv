yeah, verge is a fork of bitcoin/peercoin. You can actually see in the code that PoS (from peercoin) is in there but disabled. The site that ""leaks"" the IP's just leaks TOR nodes lol. He is extremely misinformed

 you should kill this account. this is centralizing and there's probably no way to make good use of it. 

it will always be polarizing. 

That's the only honorable way out.

From day one, Bitcoin was marketed to the world as a fast & cheap global payments network. Now the BTC crowd says that's wrong and that Bitcoin should be a slow & expensive ""store-of-value"" not meant to be used as currency. 

Who is trying to steal the Bitcoin brand, again?

A bold speculation! Keep betting as you like, but don't confuse your bets for facts. Ethereum may scale faster than Bitcoin for any number of reasons. Let's find out.

Focus, please: bitcoin (whatever its problems) has the virtue of being capped, so it cannot be abused via inflation and central bank austerity to help creditors abuse debtors and taxpayers.

what is really funny. is that as they tarnish the bitcoin name, they destroy the bitcoin cash brand as well. If #Bitcoin becomes synonimous with the new establishment, centralized financial system, being #bitcoincash will only hurt them. 

legendary self sabotage.

I think you put your finger on it. This idea of the One True Coin or One True Node is not consistent with Bitcoin (the concept).

Rami, what is your reasoning for not releasing a statement as to why you will not open a market for $btcp? If something is wrong, please let the bitcoin private community know so we can help find a solution. The 30,000 plus member community deserves a response from you.
