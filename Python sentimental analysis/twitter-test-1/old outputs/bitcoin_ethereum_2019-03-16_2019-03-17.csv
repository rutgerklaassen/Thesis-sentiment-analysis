#TRON users set another world record in DApp spending across all blockchains:
$141 million USD (5.9 billion $TRX) spent on decentralized apps in 24H

That's more than double the previous record held by #EOS ($70M in Dec 2018)

TRON truly is the House of DApps

I am thinking a mobile ATM during the power outage. Do a Wifi hotspot from a van and drive around collect requests maybe. People make the argument that Bitcoin doesn’t function without internet/power. Would be nice to turn that assumption on its head.

 I agree with you both. 

TRON is incredibly undervalued, in the next 3 months it will be proven to be vastly superior to Ethereum. 

Ethereum is currently valued at 14.93 times the value of #TRX which is absolutely absurd by any metric.

You can read here that Jed knew he had “lost” 80,000 when he sold MtGox to Mark Karpeles. I am STUNNED that Jed was able to make 80,000 Bitcoin in just a few months, let alone “lose” it.

Inside the Biggest Bitcoin Heist in History
Mt. Gox was once the biggest exchange for the virtual currency. Then half a billion dollars’ worth went missing. Emails give important clues to what happened.

They are after the cash.

You can buy Bitcoin at the machine and then come back later and steal it.

Won't the operators just disable the machines API key, after it's reported stolen? Ie It won't have Bitcoin in it, that will be sent to it as the user feeds paper cash into it. They may get the paper cash in it though...

How so? Isn't the point of bitcoin to make value seamless? If I couldn't optionally buy whatever digital or physical pieces of information I would be worried. Coinbase is just in the business of enabling people to do what they want.

What really excites me is when products teach users how to correctly think about Bitcoin. Two recent examples:
- Wasabi's strong focus on coin selection
- https://blockstream.info privacy analysis for each tx. Really, wallets should be doing that in advance.
