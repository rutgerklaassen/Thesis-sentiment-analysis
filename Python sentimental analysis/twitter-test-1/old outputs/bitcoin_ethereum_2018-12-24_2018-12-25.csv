Christmas dinner conversations:

“How’s your bitcoin thing doing?”

“Wait, so you trade fake currency for a living?”

“CNBC told me bitcoin was dead though.”

“You should cash out all your crypto profits and putting them into more conservative investments like a mutual fund.”

POW Ethereum could in theory also work without a token (at least if you believe Bitcoiners that POW without inflation can work). Introducing a native token was however nevertheless extremely useful for shared incentives and helped Ethereum grow tremendously.

I support Bitcoin from the whitepaper and 0.1. No confidence tricks. I don't give a fk about people who want to buy coins or flip coins. People will use Bitcoin when it's useful. I hope normal people don't get scammed by these billions of ICOs and alts.

What would happen if a 51% attack network upgrade:
A fork is created, all exchange and good actors will list the side with 49% hashpower as the real Bitcoin and the 51% as the Chinese Coin.
Attack failed.

What do I miss?

I don't care what ""place"" Bitcoin has on trading market cap. Is that what matters to you?

That is what is really fked up with the Bitcoin Community. How about supporting Bitcoin? How about scaling Bitcoin like Satoshi would scale it?

Yes Terranode sounds very exciting. I hear the goal is for it to do 2-4 million TPS with 500k sustained within about 2 years. This would blow away all others. Only on Bitcoin SV. #BSV

Ethereum is centralized. It has a history of transaction rollbacks being ordered by Vitalik. It's monetary policy has been changed by a central committee. And no average user can run a fully validating node. And the node counts are a complete lie, as most users use fast sync.

Bitcoin being banned implies people probably are not using it to buy coffee. Certainly not in white market coffee shops. Economic acceptance overpowering political rejection implies people paying a fee premium to get otherwise censored txs mined. https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/wiki/Censorship-Resistance-Property…

Bit gold has a more secure supply schedule than Bitcoin, but at (probably unacceptable) costs: the base layer being much harder to use, since the proofs-of-work are not fungible, and the layer 2 probably necessarily being less trust minimized than Lightning.

, the ""centralization"" you mention is the use of a Federation to turn smartBitcoins back to bitcoins due to the impossibility of Bitcoin to release funds based on an SPV proof from RSK, improvements like Drivechain are being worked
