Max is a scam artist... Do you remember Maxcoin? He created his own shitfork of Bitcoin back in early 2014 and then shilled it on his program.

He was also involved in promoting pump and dumps (notably Quarkcoin).

I don't know why anyone still gives this guy any attention

The irony is Lightning Network aka ‘scaling solution’ will not even be able to scale.

Whereas Bitcoin does.

I think my point is lost in the analogies. :D My point is that a sharded blockchain is going to serve some use cases well and some poorly. You can certainly connect a sharded Ethereum to a totally different blockchain with totally different architecture, . . .
