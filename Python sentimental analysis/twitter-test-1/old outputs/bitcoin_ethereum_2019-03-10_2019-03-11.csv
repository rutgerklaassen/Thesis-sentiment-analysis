Bitcoin (BSV) can do 18.4GB per day right now. And 4x more in may.

Anyone who have streamed Netflix understand that this is not much for a professional miner.

Is that a strange form of snobbery?

Yes, I am representative of the mainstream. I'm not a cypher-punk, an anarcho-capitalist or a Bitcoin maximalist bug. In regards to Bitcoin, I'd classify myself a 'centrist' [central core in BTC then dabble in the alts if you must].

I really hope this will not pass in Core, and that if it does people will move to a better implementation without it. Incentivizing people for not running Bitcoin nodes is the worst thing to be done now.

Smart people make the right choices eventually. It’s very easy to see once you do your own research that bitcoin is bitcoin [SV]. All other chains are forks since they have changed the base protocol they operate on. More people are seeing this everyday. Welcome my friend.

Looks like you are wrong. This estimate shows that Twitter used approx $2 billion (with a ""b"") per year on servers.

BSV is immutable, censorship resistant - and a lot cheaper by your own math.

Bitcoin's twitter clone is called http://Memo.sv
quora.com
How much is the average server cost per user for Twitter?
Answer (1 of 2): If you look at their recent filings with the SEC, Twitter reports that as at 31st March 2015 they had 302 million active users and paid $142 million in the three months to 31st March...

Aahh, skimmed the article but misread a very important point: *Total* bitcoin transaction volume drops sharply. My brain read it as “Venezuelan local bitcoin volume drops sharply” which seemed tautological. Thanks for clarification! Indeed very important if directly correlated!

How is making easier for people to just trust miners instead of validating Bitcoin rules will bring more people to validate Bitcoin instead? Doesn't make any sense. Custodian services are better in that at least many service users know they are not using Bitcoin directly.
