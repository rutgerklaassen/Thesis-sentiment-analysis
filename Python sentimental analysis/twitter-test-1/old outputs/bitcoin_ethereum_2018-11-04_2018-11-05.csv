Craig and Calvin are like sheepdogs in this analogy: They bark and they are loud, but they do that when they try to protect and warn the sheep (users). 

They relentlessly bark at the wolves (Bitcoin saboteurs), because they are protecting the farm (Bitcoin).

Bitcoin incentivized open source ethos and created a generation of developers that intimately believe in security, cryptography, free software, and cooperative computing. BTC could be found to be broken tomorrow & it would still be one of the greatest forces in computing ever.

Having Jihan makes BITCOIN's  roadmap uncertain, cos there's wormholes, plasma, Vitalik, POS, ERC20... It's just a matter of time before the whole fking altcoin circus comes to town. 

The base protocol of Bitcoin is not patented, that's the important part.

 your article appears biased and poorly researched. It is likely that the author, jack rogers, is a bitcoin cash holder and has incentive to make that sound like ""the true bitcoin"". There's no other reason to so egregiously shill a minority fork.
