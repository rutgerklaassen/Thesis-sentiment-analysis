1. Was a long time coming: Bitcoin's first building blocks were developed as early as the 1990s. 
2. It's like BitTorrent, anyone can run the Bitcoin software on their computer, you don't have to trust any third party.

Bitcoin was created to be a decentralised peer to peer cash system. Which it has failed to realise. In fact XRP is actually better suited to that than Bitcoin is. ‚ÄúIt is just a matter of time‚Äù is not a sound strategy if you a building on an unsuitable foundation.

Not necessarily. Since there shouldn't be a split, there should still be only one Bitcoin BCH that everyone will continue using after the fork. That should be Satoshi's Vision Bitcoin BCH.
