@CoinomiWallet
 and 
@ElectrumWallet
 are used a lot here).

It's being really annoying to use 
@itBit
 these days because of their lack of support to withdraw to them.

 @binaryFate01 why is Monero labeling itself as a “privacy coin”? Shouldn’t the label be “digital cash”? Is cash “privacy” money? No. Monero is digital cash. Bitcoin is “non-private” digital cash, which happens to be a contradiction

I honestly don't have a clue what these people want anymore: how does one believe Bitcoin will destroy the elites, but then also, the elites need to buy it, but then also, the elites will drive the price down, but then also, new paradigm? Like, the f*ck are they even on about?

Somebody needs to find the record of the people who have been rejected and build a bitcoin business around them! The sample we've seen in this thread suggests the rest would make a great team!
