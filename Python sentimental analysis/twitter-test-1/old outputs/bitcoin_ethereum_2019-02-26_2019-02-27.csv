Bitcoin dad you should check out some gambling DApps on the Tron platform.  I am an investor of Tronbet Ante and I am making crazy dividends each day. Very simple business model. The casino splits the profit with you each day 60/40.  No tricks or gimmicks.  Very straight forward.

Those journalists deaths weren‚Äôt in vain. They were necessary so Coinbase could criminalize Bitcoin usage and de-anon the chain.

We have our CLL ERC20 Token on Ethereum, but gas costs are to high! Waiting for Tezos to release user friendly tokenization standards, but seems they don't want to pursue this. We are stuck for now.

I've been trying to convince Pierre to do something valuable for a long time, but all he does is help people get onboarded onto the Bitcoin and Lightning networks with their own sovereign nodes. I don't know why I even bother talking to him anymore!
