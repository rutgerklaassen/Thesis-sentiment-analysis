Then there's the space of problems that's difficult-to-impossible to responsibly disclose. I've been sitting on the research that allowed me to discover the private key for a Bitcoin address containing 0.64 BTC for almost two years. Trivial compute once the algorithm is known.

Did you know promising riches is ilegal in the world of securities? But it's OK on crypto because bitcoin is an unregulated asset. Yes? I do not care if you are a decent trader, a terrible one, or the pope. Don't promise lambos or use Peter Pan certifications.
