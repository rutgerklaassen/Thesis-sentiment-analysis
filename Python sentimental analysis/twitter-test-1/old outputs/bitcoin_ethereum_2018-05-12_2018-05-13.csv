Yeah, that's one of the key differences between Bitcoin-derived currencies and ETH/XRP: All private keys and their addresses in Bitcoin already exist but most of them aren't being used yet. On ETH and XRP, addresses have to be created and announced on the network before use.

I don't think uBCH will have a future.

The same goes for bits because it is already used by Bitcoin BTC and BitcoinABC most likely will not adopt it.

Cash and XCH will be used interchangeably like we use today Dollar and USD and nobody is confused.

Exactly and Satoshi said Bitcoin was Cash in the white-paper. Not this settlement system that it has been turned into after it was hijacked by the banks.

There are 2 primary things causing the TEMPORARY dip - rumors of the #mtgox trustee getting ready to liquidate a bunch more #bitcoin and reports of a police raid on Korea's UPbit exchange

Science is necessary but not sufficient for new features to be added to Core.
