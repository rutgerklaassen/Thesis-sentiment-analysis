The halvening is now 328 days away.

Bitcoin's inflation rate will be cut to 1.8%.

Why is that important?

It will be lower than central banks 2% inflation rate and even with gold's supply rate yearly increase.

The idea that Bitcoin is just like gold is utter nonsense.  Bitcoin is nothing like gold.  It’s fool’s gold.  There is not a single use case where Bitcoin can be used as a substitute for gold.  Plus the gold price never falls by over 25% in less than 24 hours!

Yes, and during that centuries-long period of organic asset recognition, normalization, and monetary trust building across the human population, it swung just as much as Bitcoin has in these first 10 years. This is exactly what I'd expect to see in any organically adopted asset.
