Maybe your bitcoin account is running low and will be what ultimately holds you accountable for your role in the disinformation campaign.

Who knows.

Bitcoin is very very young and will stabilize over time, allowing it to serve as a currency. Only 21 million will ever exist. Governments print unlimited fiat. Patience Aron. Let‚Äôs revisit this in 5 years

Did they have the foresight to hang on to Satoshi‚Äôs Bitcoin specifically for leverage over China?
My only remaining curiosity about Bitcoin is if any person or entity has actually had the restraint not to touch those coins. (Personally, I don‚Äôt think anybody has the keys.)

Fair, no such thing would be able to kill #Bitcoin, tho politicians looking to assign blame for an ‚Äúaccident‚Äù they will claim was #BTC‚Äôs fault are a dangerous breed. Let markets work-let fiduciaries decide whether it‚Äôs worth risk to buy #WallSt‚Äôs substitute version of ‚Äúbitcoin‚Äù
