#Bitcoin and its eco system are exponential technologies,  which has very tight supply. You will be shocked how fast things move. People who sell at 100K will be sorely disappointed, IT will happen much faster than most believe.

Bitcoin is controlled by Blockstream. Blockstream pays Bitcoin Core Dev salaries. Blockstream creates ‚Äòthe problem‚Äô by limiting blocksize to sell 2nd layer such as lightning as the solution. Much of Blockstream is owned by shading Corps that are known to be in bed w/ US Gov‚Äôt.

When can we expect the next #bnb token burn?
The last (6th) Binance Coin Burn was on 16 Jan 2019
So next one should be around 16 April 2019 - right ?
