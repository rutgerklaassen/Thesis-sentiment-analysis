Thanks for what you and 
@pierre_rochard
 do. This last half year of researching bitcoin has really been a positive experience. I used to lack hope that society could ever change for the better. This mostly meat diet I've done for the month has also made me feel amazing.

Fees are not high by design. Consensus decided against block increase. reasons discussed in the development forums and githubs. All blockchains face the same scaling issues. It is mathematical fact that block size increase just delays things. 2nd layer needed.  lightning coming

#BTC is imo, the worst crypto available.  
It is a product that has no actual use case and is supported by those who seek quantity gains in terms of their own greed from a fiat currency reference point.
It's literally lost the concept a freedom to transact.
