This is why a set in stone protocol like BSV makes sense. Allowing a dev to make changes at a whim makes it have a central authority and makes it no longer Bitcoin.

That proposal isn't fair to ALL users where funds are not moved as it'd destroy MANY users coins- the death of BTC

Given my insight into this market and the players - got me in at $1 and kept me in to this day. We’ll see a $100,000 print on #Bitcoin. There’s still a lot of upside.

It's even worse as Bitcoin is in the process of moving from ECDSA to Schnorr (at least partly). AFAIK none of the 9 Post-Quantum-Signature-Scheme's from NIST have the same linearity property as Schnorr, which would mean that the move to Schnorr signatures is a one-way street

These tweets will be used to discredit everything else you say about Bitcoin, and all they'll have to do is show each other the links. However unfair or illogical or stupid you think it would be to do that, people with extreme competence in other areas are already doing so.

False 
1. Nearly every Bitcoin ever mined is for sale at some price - Some have been lost

2. Similarly, every ounce of gold ever mined is for sale, not just current production. Some was buried or lost at sea. Some is in priceless museum statues, etc. It is also not for sale.

Was I wrong to assume consistency? I assumed you'd apply the exact same logic to gold that you brazenly used against Bitcoin.
