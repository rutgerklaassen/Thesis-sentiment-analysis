And the beauty is: there are no bitcoins to buy. It's ultra scarce. What will happen with the price if 
@blackrock
 would/could buy an EtF $Btc on the 
@Nasdaq
? Yes they don't want to buy 1 or 2 bitcoin, they have huge portfolio's and they will boost the price of 1 $Btc immensely!

The $10 I ""invested"" in Bitcoin 2 years ago (totally for kicks, I promise), is now worth $5.02 and I've accepted that's as close to a win as I'm going to see.  

Don't judge me - y'all spent more than that on Powerball and this rollercoaster was well worth 10 bucks.
