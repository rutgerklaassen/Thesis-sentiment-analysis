Not enough in this community appreciate that Ethereum’s success as a technology will be irrelevant if it’s not a widely adopted economic and social network.

No one is asking those folks to conceal truth, but it would nice to leave trolling to BTC Maxis instead of our own devs.

Bitcoin (BCH) is under a penny. Why on earth would anyone pay $50 to send a digital currency.

He’s 88 years old, worth approx $90B, is considered one of the most prolific investors of all time. 

He doesn’t fear Bitcoin; the uber wealthy, at that age, don’t pivot. He’s planted his stake in the ground on the subject, don’t expect change.

You want to (a) talk about a Bitcoin scaling issue (b) on the internet and (c) want people to be civil about it.  It's a trilemma, you can only have two of the above.

Well, they were probably right. Most of them are being raised as little parasite-apprentices, destined to live on welfare subsidies. Bitcoin will make welfare-state unsustainable before 2030.  So...
