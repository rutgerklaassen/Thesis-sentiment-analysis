I said this a while back, the next 20 years or so will probably be locked in a dynamic of the developed world seeing Bitcoin as an investment, and the developing world seeing/using more as currency, with the liquidity from the former reinforcing the latter.

This doesn't take Ethereum's higher throughput into account, which makes this a rather meaningless pie chart. Ethereum does far more transactions than Bitcoin, and wallets tend to have a far better fee estimation algorithm.

Exactly. Ethereum currently processes more than double the txs of the Bitcoin blockchain (based on a 7d average) because it has greater capacity. If Ethereum had the same capacity as Bitcoin, we'd probably see higher fees being paid on its network.

Nope. My Rinkeby signer is RAID HDD and it takes half a day to sync the testnet, which is about 30GB in size. Unless we change the data format of Ethereum, I don't see it ever working with an HDD.

That said, 1.9 *can* move about 80GB of data onto an HDD ;) (`--datadir.ancient`).
