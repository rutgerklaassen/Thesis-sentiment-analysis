Thanks to everyone who tuned in to today's important Ethereum core dev call. Big shout out to those who participated in the call. I think we did a fair job gauging community consensus and coming to a resolution.

Once the protocol is fully locked down, Bitcoin is safe. Only then will the vox populi slowly understand the gravity of the truth.

There's nothing misleading about it. It's commonsense. Not everyone can afford a CPU or a cellphone or has access to electricity. Additionally, subdividing units doesn't make bitcoin more affordable for the poor, especially those who don't have two pennies to rub together.
