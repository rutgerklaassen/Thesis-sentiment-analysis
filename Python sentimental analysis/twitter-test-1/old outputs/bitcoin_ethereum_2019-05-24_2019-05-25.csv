Very interesting (and reasonable since I usually agree ) views from 
@evoskuil
 

Conversations like this makes you understand more about the economics of Bitcoin, or at least want to.

BCH is weak and can be 51% attacked at will by the miners.    Wake up people, Litecoin was Bitcoin's ""Cash"" from it's inception.  #BTC  #LTC

Yeah like DOGE is still around as a result of that, nobody remembers DOGE chain-freezes of 2014... But, no love for DigiByte :(
Still, joys of open-source, none of us would be here if it weren't for Bitcoin, and our mobile wallets are based off BRD, so gotta take the good & bad.

I’ve shared my book with several dozen nocoiners, the positive response I get, compared to previously just talking to people about bitcoin for the last 2 years, the difference is night and day. I also think in general the global conscious is also just starting to get it
