jl777 know Ins and Outs of blockchain, as well as crypto-conditions, so it helps him un huge way that he codes these smart dApps and blockchain games in 1-3 days or max of 7-14 days. But a regular bitcoin dev might do it in 10x time. Still 100x faster development I think...

These people are just grabbing the viewpoints that suit their narrative and have no interest in looking deeper or even understand Bitcoin. BTC can solve the issue of stranded energy for many power plants. BTC = Stored unit of electricity.
