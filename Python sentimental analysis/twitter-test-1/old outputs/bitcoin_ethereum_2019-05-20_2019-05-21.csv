• Bitcoin was designed to be obtained via mining, not via monitored exchanges.

• Therefore, there will be a bigger need for privacy than Satoshi may have envisioned.

• The big battle won’t be over blocksize but rather over enabling full privacy for Bitcoin.

Running a full node doesn’t allow you to define bitcoin for yourself, it allows you to assay whether something is bitcoin or not. Everything about bitcoin is defined by consensus, not your personal feelings.

That's much less likely than privacy via improvements in obfuscation and  various layer 2 schemes. Bitcoin's monetary policy must remain intact for any privacy improvements to be of value.
