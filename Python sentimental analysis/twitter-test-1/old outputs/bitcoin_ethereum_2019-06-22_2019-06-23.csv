I never said you couldn't make money trading Bitcoin.  Just don't get caught long when the music stops.  ButI did say you can't make money hodling it as the price will eventually collapse.

Your definition of dead is different from mine. Check them out and see how dead they really are. They stay developing and posting all progress with thier platform. Again the price just doesn’t reflect it but hey neither did #bitcoin when it first started.

I'm not missing anything.  You can do that with thousands of fiat crypto currencies.  So what?  But you can also do it with crypto currencies backed by gold.  The difference is when you transfer the ownership of gold you transfer something.   With Bitcoin you transfer nothing!

Great, you feel gold's properties are worth a lot. Bitcoin is the best substrate for DPKI to ever exist, something the technical identity community has been trying to find for over 30 years. Its DPKI utility feature may be worth USD trillions in value creation and cost savings.

I thought this was probably the case. He's in good company. I think that high functioning, super smart ppl on the ASD spectrum are pretty overrepresented in bitcoin. What a beautiful mind he has.

Your gold thesis is: ever-more fiat supply chasing a more stable supply of gold leads to gold appreciation. 

So clearly: ever-more fiat supply chasing an even more stable (and predictable) bitcoin supply leads to bitcoin appreciation.

Your position looks like a publicity stunt.

Please explain in clear English how exchanging bitcoin for dollars is any different than exchanging gold for dollars? 

And another note, bitcoin is easier to transact than gold (in other words, a superior medium of exchange), so why even sell?

Bitcoin is what Bitcoin was meant to be. The longest chain wins. BCH and BSV are forks. They are alt coins and will remain alt coins. I personally am glad that Core remained with small blocks. They were right. Small blocks work fine.
