When bitcoin was blocked and  treated like gold it was doomed, sad but true. Transactions were priced out reach for many, didn't work like Bitcoin anymore.

BitcoinCash BCH made Bitcoin work as intended again.

A good way to test someone's knowledge is asking the difference between the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain. It's a pretty simple question yet touches on some key fundamentals.
