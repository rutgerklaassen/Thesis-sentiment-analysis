Similarly, Mike Hearn (early/long-time Bitcoin dev.) also in 2016:

""...inescapable conclusion that it [BTC] has failed still saddens me greatly""

""Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse.""
High fees and tx delays have validated him

Exactly what I thought, but I was thinking it would be more scalable then EOS by using a Plasma Chain. I am really excited about Plasma + ZK, I expect plasma chains that can proof and set state to interact with other ethereum contracts.

The point bitcoin is decentralization and immutablity. People should only use these centralized exchanges minimally. Once they buy the coins they should immediately move their keys to addresses that they control personally. There are no tainted bitcoins IMO.
