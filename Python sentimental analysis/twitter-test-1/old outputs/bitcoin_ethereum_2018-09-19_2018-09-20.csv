XRP never made sense for intl transfers. Banks are unlikely to use GUSD tho. As an ERC20 token it‚Äôs susceptible to Ethereum‚Äôs current scalability issues, costs and vulnerabilities. 

Bank transfers are expense for customers, not for banks. No incentive for banks to switch.

Dynamics matter, static thinking leads to stagnation + vain hope for cooperation from players stuck in a broken ecosystem's Nash equilibrium. Rather change rules via lead users: ad/tracker blocking disintermediation, crypto inside to re-intermediate thru the user. GDPR helps too.

You are only measuring the use you can SEE. Most projects are stealth and in progress without announcement or public trace. Those are likely the more important ones as they represent future use cases in deployment.

If you have time to waste go back to 2011 of my twits. Almost all the gurus, inteligentia of bitcoin and even one who has written a recent book, who sent me a manuscript copy before it was published. Last week I was told I was too old to understand bitcoin and its perfection.

The network won't fracture. Bitcoin is antifragile. Most people who assume it will fracture assume that miners will set their limits randomly.  And even if reorgs may happen more it will not be noticed by normal users.  Your txn switches from being confirmed on one to the other.
