How streaming music could be harming the planet
The plastic and packaging that comes with CDs and vinyl makes them seem worse for the environment, but the popularity of music streaming services may be polluting in other ways.

Ethereum, if it succeeds, will be the global infrastructure for finance and value.

2/ Absence of evidence not evidence of absence of course.  But bitcoin tx censorship comes in two forms: peers won't relay it, or miners won't mine it. Here we care about non-technical censorship: valid, market-rate paying txs.

I have no idea where the attack was coming from, frankly.  I am positive about Bitcoin, and the industry.  Present Bitcoin as a major breakthrough and try to communicate a little bit of what it is and how it works.  Challenges presented with rebuttals/solns. Not radical!

I'm not sure a bitcoin maximalist could see it any other way. Seems to promote bitcoin as a SoV too... It's seems quite obvious that $BTC and $XRP have different value propositions but everyone insists on pitting them against one another. This space needs to mature.

Serious question here, what about all the changes in fundamentals regarding Bitcoin and the institutions that are building around it?
Does that hold absolutely zero weight?
Those have changed tremendously from the beginning of the bullrun til now.

The slides are all describing Bitcoin early days and ~10 min was approx.  The talk begins with stripped down, basic tech, basic wallet, no bells/whistles, high level.  Not intending to take any stand on today's performance or lightning or any current debates!

Also, precious metals were expensive to validate without trusting a mint to reliably coin it, a trust that was often abused, as was the trust in IOUs & other derivatives. Validation of Bitcoin is very inexpensive, and universal when receiving money on the Bitcoin main chain.
