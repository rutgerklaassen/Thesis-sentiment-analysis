Technically, all chains are competing & I consider every SC platform both competition & complimentary to Ethereum (this is how the space moves forward).

Polkadot is a unique case because of its close ties to the Ethereum ecosystem through Parity/W3F (and the whole EIP999 mess).

They honestly FOMO-ed into the market. By the time that demographic had sparked an interest to get involved in bitcoin the top was in. The insane runs were on the final stretch. They missed it. Now we're down in the dead-zone, low volatility, etc... They'll come back around 10k

Polkadot isn’t a smart contracts platform, it’s a networking protocol. It’s a different later of abstractions.

w/o a smart contracts chain like Ethereum (as well as a bunch of other chains) 
@polkadotnetwork
 is pretty useless :)
