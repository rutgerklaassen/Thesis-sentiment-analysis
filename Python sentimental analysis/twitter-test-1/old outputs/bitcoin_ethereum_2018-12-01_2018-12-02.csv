From my point of view, Chainlink brings 3 key attributes to the table: 1) Connectivity for smart contracts to off-chain data and off chain resources (payment systems, backend systems), 2) Confidential smart contracts 3) Scalable smart contracts

These are all based on many unpredictable, fortuitous prophecies coming true (e.g. bitcoin acceptance, hyperbitcoinization). It’s literally the investor pitch at this point. At this point in time, the dynamics are closer to a pyramid scheme. Until those prophecies are realized.

Power grid loss would destroy all markets. Also you can send/receive bitcoin without internet and cell service. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/10/16/bitcoin-offgrid-transactions/…

If you want it in your hands you can print a paper wallet.

Dev sends Bitcoin without using the web or the power grid
One day we might all be able to send Bitcoin from literally anywhere in the world, with no electricity and no internet connection.

Price predictions are a natural part of #bitcoin's evolution, but only 1 aspect of the network & don't harm btc's health overall. We continue to see repeating fractal patterns of increasing magnitude in the market so objectively, over time, we see where the price is headed, .

You are wrong. That is the main fallacy among bitcoiners. Very damaging. It's terrible how one of the main bitcoin premises is false. See, most bitcoiners do not understand interest rates. I'll write a thread on real intetest rates at some point.

Nobody is supposed to save in fiat. Fiat is not designed to appreciate in time. Well managed fiat depreciates slightly every year, by design. For saving, invest in financial or real assets. Can also retain value by using a MONEY MARKET account instead of a savings/checking acct.
