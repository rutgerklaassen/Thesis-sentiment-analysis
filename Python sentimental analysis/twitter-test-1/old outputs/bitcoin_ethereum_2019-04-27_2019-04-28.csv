Bitcoin is Available under Partition (AP) . Calling it partition tolerant gives the notion that it tolerates partitions, which sound like a good thing... 
Of course, to be fair, we cannot get a CP system that is as open to Sybils as Bitcoin.

Price (which is what matters when the concerns inflation) is a consequence of supply *and* demand. Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply does not ensure demand, nor does it eliminate the very real possibility of comparable substitutes. https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-system/wiki/Scarcity-Fallacy‚Ä¶
