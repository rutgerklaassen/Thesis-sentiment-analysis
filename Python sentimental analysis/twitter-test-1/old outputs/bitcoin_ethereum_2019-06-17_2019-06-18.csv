The only threat Libra has to XRP or Bitcoin is when A Pompous ass says nonsense that’s starts an internal crypto conflict rather than allowing all to work together and inform people its a major privacy issue and the real cryptocurrencies, both BTC and XRP, are better options.

Pretty intelligent people understand that the energy usage for Bitcoin is not sustainable. Very environmentally unfriendly which will not be accepted in the future.

Waiiit! Don’t transfer from regular Coinbase to external wallet! Send it to your Coinbase Pro wallet then transfer to external wallet! It’s FREE and faster that way. Yes, it’s FREE>NO TRANSFER FEES! I don’t think a lot of people know about this real-life cheat code. #bitcoin $btc

Bitcoin is like early electricity. Raw, dangerous, seems very volatile and hard to use. With time it'll start to feel safer, easier and normal. Like electricity it will inspire and power new unimaginable industries. And one day we’ll wonder how did we live without it?

Give it time and allow it to work. I see so many people on Twitter speculating on every candle.

Almost nobody knows about XRP. Most people just buy Bitcoin. People normally do zero research, so no worry. Something like 0.02% is invested in XRP and then 80% owns a very small amount, so don’t worry
