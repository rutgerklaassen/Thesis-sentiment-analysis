What makes blockchain outside of BitCoin is distributed ledger technology, with a stack of services and applications and frameworks. Then again, it is mostly ease of use which prevails.

No. I mean it would be too easy/ too desirable for Bitcoin to do as you suggest. The most probable outcome is the one that will frustrate the maximum amount of people in their predictions... which too often reflect their wishes.

Did you know BTC has a bigger ratio of chinese miners than BCH?

Shills tell lies... the lies are not coming from here pal.

Always remember, BCH has the same historical ledger as BTC, it has a multi-dev team, and anyone in the world can mine it. Centralization myth is propaganda

Couldn't agree more. More so, compared with how simple and elegant Bitcoin Cash is, and works as fast without the pain of on/off chain ramps.

You have no idea just what a difference a bigger blocksize makes.
But also the removal of the RBF for instant payments.

This isn't about having a crazy settlement layer called Bitcoin. this is about commerce enablement.
