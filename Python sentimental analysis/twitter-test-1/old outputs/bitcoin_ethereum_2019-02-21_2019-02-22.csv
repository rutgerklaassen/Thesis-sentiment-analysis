wow why would ebay sponsor a crypto thing? After ebay's recent diminished partnership with paypal, maybe its eyeing bitcoin payments next?

It‚Äôs so weird to talk to and interact with people who are into ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù but feel like it‚Äôs ok to punt on privacy. Before Bitcoin the two felt inextricably intertwined. Now we have people who are into cryptography without privacy self-identifying as cypherpunks and it‚Äôs nauseating

My 2¬¢: 

CSW rode the current culture war's 'revolt against the elites' meme to successfully convince his followers the leading BCH implementation was 'Core 2.0' and sold them a 'good old days', 0.1.0, immaculate vision of Bitcoin. Also patents.

Quite an interesting phenomenon

I want to introduce ways to view pastes that are popular/curated. I can see ways it would be possible to rank based on tips if I created a specialised Bitdb with planaria, but not sure how feasible it is with existing bitdbs.

While I‚Äôm super bullish for Ethereum based gaming, gamers are also the pickiest, snobbiest population. They will accept only the best experience. We need top tier game development firms, with top tier Ethereum asset mechanisms to really go mainstream.

Same. I don't have time to perform other people's due diligence. Feel free to follow me to keep up with what's happening with Ethereum though.

Bitdb only picks up txs that exist on the blockchain and the mempool. So the first step would be to check if the transaction actually exists on Bitcoin.

1. Get tx hash
2. Check block explorers with hash
3. Check Bitdb https://babel.bitdb.network/query/1DHDifPvtPgKFPZMRSxmVHhiPvFmxZwbfh/ewogICJ2IjogMywKICAicSI6IHsKICAgICJmaW5kIjogewogICAgICAidHguaCI6ICJiOGIwZTNlNWRkZTcwZTE1ZGI4YzUwNDJhNTY4NTFjNTE0ZTZlNDE2ZDVkMGYwNDYwOGRkNzEzOGExNDBiYjM3IgogICAgfQogIH0KfQ==‚Ä¶ (Replace ‚Äútx.h‚Äù value with your hash)
