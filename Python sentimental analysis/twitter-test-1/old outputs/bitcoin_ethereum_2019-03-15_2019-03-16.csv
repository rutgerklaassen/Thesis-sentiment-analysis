I completely agree with your assessment of decentralised oracles and like what ChainLink is doing. If you think LINK is undervalued, have a look at $ZAP, which solves the oracle problem with innovative curation markets, is live on Ethereum mainnet and has a marketcap of <2m

It is ironic to call me the luddite, as I'm not the one afraid of new technology like bitcoin.  

If one group were to be labelled luddites, it would surely by the LN proponents attempting to recreate old-fashioned banking on top of bitcoin.

Just like bitcoin developers sell bitcoin. Consensys sells eth yet with no transparency or escrow to mitigate it. Not to mention the xrp they sell goes to the blockchain ecosystem and philanthropy. Ripple the company is funded by venture capital and software profits.
