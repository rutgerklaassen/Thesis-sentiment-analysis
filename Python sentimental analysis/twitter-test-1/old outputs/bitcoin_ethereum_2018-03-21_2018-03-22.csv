Agreed; that's the guarantee Ethereum fast sync relies on, too, and I personally think the idea that all live nodes could agree to break the rules without leaving any evidence later is pretty ridiculous. I think losing the ability to sync from 0 would suck, though.

Almost full blocks behave like a highway with traffic close to it's capacity. Just a fewe extra cars and queues will start to build up. Building a highway with enough lanes to keep up with peak hours is often too expensive. With bitcoin however, it's not a problem.
