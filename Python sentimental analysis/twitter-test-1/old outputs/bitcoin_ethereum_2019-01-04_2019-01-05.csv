Email has had many problems over its decades of use, but no one talks about those problems as if they're in any way important. Email is a global, world changing success; it's flaws are irrelevant. And of course, Bitcoin's record is much better than email. Perspective is key.

I'm talking about the principle of nitpicking, which isn't useful. The general principle that Bitcoin's operation has been flawless is true; pointing out the errors that no one should be concerned about misses the point that BTC is a spectacular success; that's what's important.

The business leaders and thought leaders will be the ones with balanced mentalities and bridging skills that will enable to speak to and serve the general public. Perfectionists will never be able to do this, and their voices will dwindle as Bitcoin becomes a global phenomenon.

Use a market to swap VEO for synthetic BTC, then you can use an atomic swap to trade synthetic BTC for BTC.
