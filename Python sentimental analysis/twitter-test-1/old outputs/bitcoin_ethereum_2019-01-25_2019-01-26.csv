Anybody faulting

 for the temporary stay of the shutdown needs to have their heads examined. This is a LIFELINE to the federal workers who aren't getting paid. (1 of 2)

Its 2047, the People’s Republic of Badguys is shutting down nodes. Hiro Protagonist will have his VR world wiped out if he doesn’t come up with .0172 Bitcoin in a week. A huge sum.
Fortunately his uncle has digital securities for a Irish tech stock to trade for BTC via satellite.

I'm certainly against a collectivism / ""outsourced thinking"" scenario for bitcoin. Hopefully my articles haven't lead you to believe otherwise.

1/ Time to shine a light on Bitcoin’s informal governance, often called a “culture war.”

Let's explore “in-fighting,” lessons learned from failed forks, dispel forking FUD, and highlight benefits of Bitcoin’s informal governance.

We should all just recognize that we agree that it’s wrong to harm people. 

This argument is about 95% over labels, titles and symbols. Words and definitions matter, but they don’t matter more than people. 

Let’s have more valuable conversations.

if you manage to explain what Crony-Capitalism is to Ed you'll 'win'. As it is, he thinks its a made up word, so he constantly confuses Capitalism with Crony-capitalism. It's like trying to get a colour blind person to see 2 colours when they can only perceive one.
