If you want proof of the wretchedness of humanity, watch the ""crypto"" space. 

If you want proof of the brilliance of humanity, watch #Bitcoin.

Total FUD. Bitcoin will save the environment. What is the damage done by hiring staff to run banks? Office space, electricity, data centers with duplicate ledgers, the list goes on and on. Bitcoin is the most efficient way to validate transactions.

""Public interest in Bitcoin"" is not static. I don't know about you, but I don't want to go back to tx fees of $100 next time there's a surge in interest.

Even now, occasionally I encounter full blocks and disproportionate fees.

They brought in Luke Mulks to integrate Bitcoin into Brave about 2 years ago. Then the team realized Bitcoin Core was impossible to work with. BCH didn't exist yet, so they created an Ethereum token. The world is very different now. If ETH can't scale, they will bail.
