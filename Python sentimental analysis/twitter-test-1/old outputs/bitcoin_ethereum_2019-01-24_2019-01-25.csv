Would it be possible to have physical Bitcoin paper notes? I mean could create 10 bitcoin addresses, load each of those with say 0.01btc and go shopping with it? When you pay you would basically give the private key and hence the access to the funds. Would this work?

No recommendations implied, price information is neural. I've bought one crypto personally: Bitcoin. I did short a few other things when I felt they were way over value. And to buy, sell or short you need dependable price information. This is it.

If you think you can actually convert your bitcoin millions into funds you can spend productively in the US economy on real assets  ‚Äì houses, cars, whatever ‚Äì while skating this, you're neglecting a very long history of prosecuting money laundering.

""We""

In this case ""we"" = bitcoin maxis

Shure... bitcoin maxis ... taking a lot of time, and money to analyze xrp in a neutral way.

Good joke 
Nice try

You should learn about the decentralized digital asset, $XRP. Whatever you can do with any other crypto, you can do with XRP -faster in cheaper.
