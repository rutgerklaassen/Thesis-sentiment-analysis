The average user can be their own bank and verify their own transactions with a SPV wallet, that requires no more data than a SMS text message package for a dumb phone in Nepal.  This will always be true regardless of how big blocks get.

See Section 8 of the bitcoin white paper.

Bcash starting to panic...
LN is actually working, #Bitcoin (the real one, $BTC) usage is higher then ever and fundamentals are amazing.

Meanwhile BitcoinCash has no real life adoption at all, nothing but lies and promises.

 will lower fees by utilizing xRapid/$XRP and then Visa can still be used by Kroger. Or Kroger will do just fine using

No, I am telling you that calling them out is futile because nobody even knows who ""they"" are and  people will continue to do this sort of thing, Bitcoin or no Bitcoin. Unless they physically threaten you, I suggest you just ignore them.

No, this is a perfect example of moronic attempts to freeride security, and why we are not raising the blocksize to allow every moron out there to pile their externalities on top of Bitcoin. Secure your own fucking chain.
