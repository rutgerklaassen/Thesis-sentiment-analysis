In 2009, Bitcoin rewarded individuals with technical skills and talent. They were the only people who could access the digital currency initially.

This wasn't the first time technical skills were rewarded handsomely and it won't be the last.

I think bitcoin's scarcity and everyone's confidence in that scarcity going forward is no. 1 i.e. it's a game of hard monies, and the hardest money wins. 

Fungibility helps, and my view is bitcoin will get 'good enough' fungibility and privacy with coming tech

 should add this as an option. Currently the ledger hardware will connect to selected wallets. It can integrate PSBT to be compatible to Bitcoin Core directly and also offer this option for PSBT compatible wallets. They can keep both legacy method and new PSBT standard.

It's a fascinating story. This solves years of technical debates on wallet remote signing standards. Some groups more happy than others about Bitcoin Core's choices (which become de facto the standard) but now we can move forward to actually building secure apps.
