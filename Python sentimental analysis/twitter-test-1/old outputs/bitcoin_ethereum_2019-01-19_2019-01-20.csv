It's not only coding stuff but understanding how transactions work, bitcoin protocol stuff etc.

Been trying for days.

You can always just ask the NSA, GRU, Bitcoin miners, and many others who own your machine to help out. Downtime hurts others too, Tom, so don't be selfish.

Glad you managed to get help for your Robert, great stuff. Just a pity 
@CoinDeal_
 was unwilling to work with us to do the same for the DAPS community due to wanting 5 BTC fee for a simple ERC20 integration. Thankfully
