* Continues to experience extreme separation anxiety and fear of forks
* Resistant to change, and reluctant to play with others
* Keeps repeating the same story over and over again.

He's a bit strange but we love him anyway

Once this catches on and people with money realize they can secure their funds and earn 7-8%, BILLIONS of dollars more will flow in.  I am giving up on everything else but Bitcoin and Tron.  There is nothing else.  My wife and my side-chick.  #INVEST

You ignore the fact that centralized competitors are illegal or have high friction from regulation. If you were around in 2010, wouldn‚Äôt you have said tht Bitcoin could never compete with a centralized digital currency? I imagine you‚Äôd say ‚ÄúBitcoin is clunky & Venmo works great!‚Äù
