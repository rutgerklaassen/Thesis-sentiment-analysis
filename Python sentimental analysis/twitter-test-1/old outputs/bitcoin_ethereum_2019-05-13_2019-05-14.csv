“What!!”

“Our broker put me into Uber at $48.  Then he made my buy more in the IPO at $45”

“What’s the price now?”

“Of bitcoin?”

It’s exciting.

And hilarious.

I discoverd Bitcoin in 2012, mined a couple when it was at $12, sold most at $20. Rediscovered it in 2015, accumulated up until 2017, lost 80% in the bear market. 

Still alive, still fighting.

Last year’s crypto call, would have subtracted 180bp...

So bitcoin this year in first 5 months is more than offsetting the horrendous bear market

Looks like y'all had a awesome time together. I'm jealous, wish I could have made it. Maybe next year when Bitcoin is at $43,000.

Bitcoin now at $8000.00. Those of you in the old school who believe this is a bubble simply have not understood the new #mathematics of the #Blockchain, or you did not cared enough to try. Bubbles are mathematically impossible in this new paradigm. So are corrections and all else
