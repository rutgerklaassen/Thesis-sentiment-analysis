""There’s nothing magical about Bitcoin’s monetary policy that can’t be adopted by centralized entities"" - this is where I'd say he's wrong. There are strong tendencies in a democracy towards big-govt spending, and these drive poor monetary policy choices by govt

That's not what's happening. What's happening is that people who get some value from the ledger run validators to preserve their ability to get that value. This is the same thing that happens with bitcoin full nodes. 1/2

I don't understand bitcoin and how it has value

Regarding the electricity, as far as I understand, the simple answer is that bitcoin is insanely encrypted, which takes a lot of processing power to encrypt with each transaction. That processing power takes a ton of electricity.

You're confusing lack of a direct monetary incentive with lack of an incentive. There are incentives for users to run validators and they don't cost much to run. 

Not to mention Bitcoin relies on unpaid volunteers to run full nodes. Is that a problem?
