Yes I started my account a while ago to grab Tweetybird (like Twitter). I never used it til 2018 after I invested in crypto hence my description ""Twitter was useless until I discovered Bitcoin Cash."" A lot of ppl agree it was useless til crypto. Still nothing unusual there.

Proshares Bitcoin ETF denial will be just as bad as the Winklevoss ETF denial and the Solid VanEck Bitcoin ETF delay. People don’t realize that whales love it when retail FOMOs so they can dump on them. The bottom will be within the next couple weeks most likely after MAJOR FUD.

Nice interview. But we are trying to think about ways of fixing this  by using the same rotten system. I think we need big changes in how we think to make the changes required. Banking, for example, needs to be flushed and rebooted. I’m not into Bitcoin, but its trying to do this

We still haven't bottomed out yet so this is a bulltrap. I have a feeling that we will be getting major FUD in the next couple of weeks to finally bottom out. Don't forget the Proshare Bitcoin ETFs will most likely get denied Aug 23 so everyone will dump just like Winklevoss ETF.

The people who most want to see every Bitcoin project fail are literally the most powerful people in the world. There actually IS a conspiracy (central banking) in opposition to Bitcoin

That there WOULDN'T be agents of that conspiracy ingratiating themselves is ridiculous.

I bought $200,000 worth yesterday morning and the order was filled quickly and it didn't move the price.  I was under the impression that the bitcoin provider ETN has a lot of volume and liquidity, so maybe this is just the OTC CXBTF showing low volume.  https://xbtprovider.com
