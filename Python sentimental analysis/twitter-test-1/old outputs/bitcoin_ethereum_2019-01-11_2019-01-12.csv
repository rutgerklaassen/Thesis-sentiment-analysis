In case CT needed more evidence that #TRON is a massive marketing scam, here's Simon Morris comments in @BreakerMag regarding the BitTorrent integration: 
""The transaction capacity is simply not there. We were going to melt Tron. Literally destroy it.”

Not so!  We just understand the difference between sovereign currency issued by the State and an investment. 
As long as you are measuring Bitcoin in US dollars or other State issued money, and can't pay your taxes with Bitcoin - it's a commodity - not a currency.
