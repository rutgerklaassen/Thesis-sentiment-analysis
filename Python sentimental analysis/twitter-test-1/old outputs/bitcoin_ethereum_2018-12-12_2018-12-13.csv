Merkle tree roots can be written into a hash, to store within the Bitcoin blockchain, thereby creating an immutable historical record.  Paper shredding banksters evidence of collusion can be eliminated. It is or it is not. ""Personal responsibility is the new counterculture""

It's almost as if you guys are rediscovering why all the arguments for the 2x ""upgrade"" were wrong. The SV hardfork seems to have disabused you of all the nonsense you were spouting a year ago.

So glad we don't have to deal with this stuff in #Bitcoin anymore.

This entire thread is a few people refusing to call a vote a vote.
Theres obviously no literal ballot box in Bitcoin, but the word is used to express how the network reaches a consensus. Miners ""vote, verb. INFORMAL
used to express a wish to follow a particular course of action""

What he was trying to accomplish was clear, they were building a new backbone for the financial system. Bitcoin isn't merely digital cash, but an alternative to banks.
