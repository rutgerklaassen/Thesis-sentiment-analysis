Gold has lasted the test of time as a culturally important metal/hedge against money printing decadence.

BTC is useless & manipulated.

No.

The only vocal about  it is Pieter Wuille. He openly recommended do not use #Bitcoin UTXOs if you are concerned about #quantum

There is not valid solution proposed yet. All of them implies forget about vulnerable wallets.

In my experience, once U truly understand ALL aspect of advanced flow

it can be applied to ANY asset + market 

Bitcoin + Spoozcoin alike

Why? 

Supply + Demand remain the constant

The motivation is more the apparent inevitability of a Bitcoin-dominated economy, and the preference of exponential improvements over incremental.  It seems more like the majority support competition, but realize that Bitcoin has none.

Everything else (to date) is a carbon-copy.

I suspect you and Peter‚Äôs comments make more sense to people in a bitcoin bear market discouraging them from buying bitcoin while it‚Äôs cheap, and then in a euphoric rally your words fall on deaf ears and they buy the peak. Same will happen this cycle.

Futures dont trade on weekend, when price of Bitcoin changes over the weekend it's typical to see the price leave a gap on the futures chart

Gaps usually are filled by price typically - price would come back down to explore that gap

But it's not 100% especially in strong trend
