All of that is possible, but none of them can stop Bitcoin.

Jun 29, 2019","Seeing so many comments of users posting s/s of his website, I think I know what 
@PeterSchiff
 is up to.

It's obvious that it's a publicity stunt to make more people aware that he accepts Bitcoin for his gold business.

Deep down he just wants to #stacksats like the rest of us.

Literally an unaltered screenshot from his website posted without comment with the words ""Bitcoin Accepted Here"" with the Bitcoin logo and he calls me a liar...?

The cognitive dissonance is real and deep. twitter.com/PeterSchiff/st…

No it's about communist cypherpunks finding out that the creator of bitcoin is their arch nemesis and so they want to make it their life mission to spear and stain his good name and reputation.

So it's not just some innocent attention seeking stuff... just take a birds eye view of what BTC is (clearly not bitcoin... a means to allow for destruction of evidence trails... to destroy the original idea of bitcoin). They HATE bitcoin...but seek to claim the name and coopt it

3 monies. DAI, ETH, BTC. 

It might spell the death for the Bitcoin blockchain, tho. The more utility we can provide BTC on Ethereum, the more incentive there is to move BTC on Ethereum. More BTC tx on Ethereum, less for the Bitcoin blockchain.

 should be aware of the legal issues with segwit and removing signatures before implementing it. In fact he should stay away from the whole segchain altogether, it is cancer and not Bitcoin or Satoshi's design:
coindesk.com
The Risks of Segregated Witness: Possible Problems Under US Contract Law
Jimmy Nguyen of nChain provides an opinion on possible legal issues with the SegWit scaling proposal should it activate on bitcoin's network.

It can't stop the die-hard enthusiasts running their nodes, no, but Bitcoin's corpse would be worthless, and effectively destroyed.  Bitcoin's value is based on perception, not persistence
