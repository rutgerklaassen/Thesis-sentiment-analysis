Derivative ETF is not the only option and concluding that poor behavior by some exchanges is somehow a death sentence for the product mixes fact with opinion about Bitcoin in general.

Okay, I'll bite. (disclaimer: I hold BTC) - Stellar+XLM is a better Bitcoin than Bitcoin on virtually every measure except adoption, which comes with time. But Stellar as a protocol is far more than Bitcoin ever aspired to be. yet, I see productive coexistence in the future.

Counterpoint: Venezuela and Turkey will shut down fiat-crypto exchanges. When that happens, tokenized-fiat will be less accessible than minable crypto like Bitcoin.

It would be interesting to see how big a block could have been created if the network was predominantly BU nodes instead.

Bear markets distorts our perception of time. Bitcoin is in a long term roaring market. In the grand scheme of things it means nothing if it the next large move up is now, in 3 months, in 12 months... or back in March. It only matters to the extreme market timers

Im big fan of the product but saying it‚Äôs better for this use case than Bitcoin is ridiculous.

People have an easier time getting USD cash than Gemini dollar.

How hard is it to KYC/AML someone in Venezuela for example? Is Gemini available in Venezuela? 

Very complex.

Those network disturbances. That‚Äôs the free market telling you to scale down your blocksize. It‚Äôs not something to be avoided. It won‚Äôt cause catastrophic failure. Worse case you are orphaned. That carries with it built in penalties already. Let‚Äôs stop nannying miners.

I find it high suspect though that you‚Äôre so keen on cleanliness of the subreddit that more than one post on the issue is overkill. Did you remove Lukejrs post? Does anyone even use Bitcoin Knots?

- TL;DR 8

- somebody WILL fork lumens network for private network with permissionned node-list 

OR

- somebody will fork lumens to have bitcoin-payable network 

OR, more likely, 

- both 

Conclusion: stellar is good tech but Lumens currency is a pyramid scheme to fund R&D
