The reactions below your posts are extremely similar to the ones below posts critical about #Bitconnect when this was huge...

When people are this aggressive about something it's usually pretty bad. (I say this as a #Bitcoin enthousiast and know you are critical about it)

You hate the man for no good reason except he admits to being Sotoshi? He cares about the success of the original bitcoin protocol, and is calling out all of these illegal token scams. Suppose it makes sense for those involved to hate him.

I understand your cocern Naomi that not holding the line on checking govt power will lead to the Bitcoin system being coopted.

But I strongly believe Bitcoin is becoming so big and strong it'll coopt governments and fundamentally change how they operate.

Bitcoin will succeed in China as a superior SOV.  Chinese have been buying up foreign assets in order to preserve their wealth for decades as the RMB loses value.  Cap flight has affected property values in Canada, NY, and SF.  BTC is a more convenient SOV than gold or RE.

well - it depends on your goals. if you want to own a little $BTC the way you'd own $TSLA in your Schwab / eTrade account, by all means use Coinbase. 

if you are a person who wants to own bitcoin as an alternative to surveillance capitalism, DO NOT use coinbase.
