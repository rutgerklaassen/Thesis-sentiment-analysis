Bitcoin is one of the few investment opportunities w/ the upside traditionally only available to VCs. I wasn’t an accred investor in 2013. If Bitcoin were limited to accredited investors, my life would be very different. I’d like to see everyone have this opportunity across mkts.

I find it very bizarre that a pro-Ethereum tweetstorm that doesn't disparage any other project became so popular and slightly contentious simply because we dare to be confident about Ethereum's potential success.
