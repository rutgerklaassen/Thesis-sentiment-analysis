Blockchain-Based Websites Aim to Disrupt Facebook by Paying Their Users

Man so true. I first became interested in bitcoin in 2014. Accumulated around 4 btc at around $400 then sold 6 months later around $300. Not going to make the same mistake again. #hodl

Very interesting move on exchanges on this mega pump.
Too many little buys at market Price, bassically FOMOing, but apparently not order from Smart Money. 

At this point if Smart Money know something we don't is very strange they didn't jump just before everybody else.

Sure, but 99% of people don't know (and don't have to know) about what Bitcoin really is or should be.

Whatever gets mainstream adoption on a big niche first, will win.

I'm working everyday trying to help Bitcoin Cash become the winner.
