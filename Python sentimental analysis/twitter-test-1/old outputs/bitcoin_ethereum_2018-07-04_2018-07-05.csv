Ethereum: We created digital assets on our blockchain over a failed PoW system with 12 second blocks that clogs every 2 days and it is not secure nor trusting.
Bitcoin: we created an offchain network that can work on top of Bitcoin 100% secure and only usable by consensus.

Where are you getting SHUN from? We just want questions answers and reassurances. You should be saying hey CSW all these people are full BCH ers but they are scared of some of what you are saying could you put a paper together and answer the criticisms? For the good of BCH?

Uasf actually refers to a watershed moment in btc history last year demonstrating that miners don’t singlehandedly control bitcoin.

Decoding the date of birth, is it correct that Satoshi was born on January 3, 1969?
This comes from a careful review of scriptSig, which I don't need to explain to the person who created the original #bitcoin source code. Curious, will Satoshi confirm that my analysis is correct?

Lol! Last year we demonstrated fees on bitcoin's blockchain so large that the only complaint anyone had was how to make them smaller. Now you are sure that the fees won't be big enough by 2024 to keep the miners interested?

You clearly have a lot to learn about bitcoin.

I use iOS too, but malicious Javascript running in the browser to mine Bitcoin etc. (what this was doing) cannot be easily detected or prevented because it is embedded in the code that powers the web page.
