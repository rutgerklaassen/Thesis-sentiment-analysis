Actually, CREATE2 can *improve* the situation here, because it commits to the init code and the creator. That means you can verify entirely offline if the init code (and hence the deployed code) is ""safe"", something you can't do with CREATE.

Bad yet instructive example. When a licensed bank is robbed, account holders are protected. Thank you prudential regs. https://medium.com/@alexgladstein/a-human-rights-activists-response-to-bitcoin-critics-d50e6760ee80…

You always talk about how bad printing money is and the lack of a cap on fiat currencies, yet you think it’s okay to create more #Bitcoin? You need to refine your monetary stance and start looking at finance from the perspective of a generation that is about to refine yours.

The XRP Ledger is not centralised and does not require centralised trust. That is what thole point. In fact with Bitcoin the trust is centralised into fewer hands that it is with XRP.

4/ What’s the use case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Well, they are the first digital bearer instrument the world has ever known. This reality is independent of whatever the price may be today, last year or in the future.

Yes, that's the beauty of Bitcoin, you can be a random guy like me on twitter or a company with trillions of dollars worth of assets, anyone can participate and there is no pay to play (except network fees).
