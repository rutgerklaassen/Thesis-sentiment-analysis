It is much easier to deploy new consensus-level technologies on Liquid/Elements than on Bitcoin. For example, we already have CT. I wouldn’t be surprised if when Simplicity comes to fruition it would also be deployed on Liquid/Elements first. But I’m just speculating.

Sorry for the confusion.

We are trying to indicate that some of the data is comparing transaction volume of Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin transactions which segregate the witness of at least one of the inputs.

i.e. SegWit  volume vs Bitcoin Cash volume (not Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash)

It's still a fact that the Liquid is not as trustless as bitcoin. I'd say best case it's about as trustless as Ripple or EOS. So by using Liquid for issued assets, you're still adding an orthogonal trust component to the equation for the integrity of the tokens.
