Let me translate for the newcomers what Adam is saying. #Bitcoin is and will be the only cryptocurrency with 100% security, which means it is the only crypto that can become a world currency and unit of account. In the new world we are moving to 99.8% is not enough, sell ur alts.

The way Steve Jobs would deal with this is to just call everything Ethereum. No confusion. You came for Ethereum, that's what you get. When a new release is out, it's just the *new* Ethereum.

The irony is that a lot of the supposed Bitcoin ""elitists"" only learnt about the reorg ""attack vector"" yesterday.

There's no veil. This possibility of a (""friendly"") 51% attack has been there since the start of Bitcoin in 2009. And about the choice aspect: the community en large (devs, users & miners) decides if such friendly reorg should happen. Binance quickly realized: nobody wants this.

If we want to be really honest, the biggest branding snafu is probably Ethereum 2.0. Sets lofty expectations, confusion around migration and makes anything ""less"" then it seem less important.

There's cost to getting the CEO of a unicorn discussing re-orging Bitcoin on twitter. Binance unfortunately paid that cost, pretty much for no gain (which was to be expected). It's unfortunate that this had to happen.
