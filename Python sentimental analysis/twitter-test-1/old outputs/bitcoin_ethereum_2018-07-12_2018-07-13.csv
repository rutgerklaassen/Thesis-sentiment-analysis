Correct, but of course the fiery tweets wouldn't stop the changes as much as the fact that over 130,000 node runners simply wouldn't want to download any version of bitcoin with such a change.

It might be an exaggeration to say 100 or 500, but it appears to me that very few people grasp the economics and the technology enough to know why bitcoin will work.
