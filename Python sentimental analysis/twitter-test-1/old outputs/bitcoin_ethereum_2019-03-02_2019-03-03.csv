By the time we have mainstream speculator adoption #bitcoin will be in the $1-2 million per #bitcoin or $100-200/ 10,000 Sats. With in 5-10 years. This is not that difficult. The process is taking shape right now. Main stream Saver adoption will be in $10-20 million per bitcoin.

I don't consider myself an Ethereum maximalist (I don't even think that's a thing) but I'm not a fan of ""Proof of Kumbaya"" either.

My main issue is that LN is being portrayed as this ""wild success"" while Ethereum-based apps are constantly shit on.
