Perhaps it is the value of the dollar which is fluctuating in Bitcoin terms.  A Bitcoin is a Bitcoin, what is the dollar worth?

No, these academics do have skin in the game, and lots of it: funding coming from various (alt-)coin and ICO sources.

I suspect this is the biggest problem, as it creates strong incentives to ignore dishonest and scammy behavior. E.g. Scaling Bitcoin's ICO sponsor.

Yes. And we're getting so inured to these - or oblivious - when we find out Backpage was taken down for child trafficking & *also* laundering over $500,000,000 in #bitcoin.

You realize how much child trafficking they were presumably involved in, to launder that much bitcoin?

Which means, if you had a hand in it, that all those bitcoin launderers are identified, right along with the folks trafficking the children. To me, a pacificist at heart, a child trafficker, absolutely proven as such, should be a dead trafficker. It is the worst of crimes.
