Don't agree! The idea of #Substratum and #Modum is far away from a shit-coin!
But Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin SV, Tron or BTT will survive just because of fake volume and teaming up with Binance? Not fair...

That's a nice thought, however Bitcoin algorithm is designed to avoid inflation, there are a limited amount of Bitcoins so if it reaches adoption, price simply can't be at 1$ because there will only be 21 Million Bitcoin in circulation. People will rather trade Satoshis.

And the answer that would be that it won't take very long before you've made enough returns that even if this happens, you've still done well. I actually used to hear this argument about bitcoin -- what if the blockchain breaks and all bitcoins become worthless....

There is a clear conflict of interest between working for a competing chain of ETH 2.0, and ethereum. Besides the parity bug's before constantinople release only make it look worse. It would be best if you worked only for one chain.
