Your developer section needs a lot of work. It largely references Github activity, and uses BTC's 10yr cumulative Github activity. You'd think Bitcoin would have the most robust Github if you didn't know any better.

The reality is it's not even close to the most active Github.

This is a hash marathon than can go on for months if it has to.
