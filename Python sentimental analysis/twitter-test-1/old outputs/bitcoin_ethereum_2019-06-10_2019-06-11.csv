Only a handful of those actually own #Bitcoin. I know from direct experience that most of those institutions have no interest in BTC and most think it's going to fade away in the future. BTC isn't some sure thing.

It's about the journey more than the destination. What does every institution owning Bitcoin actually *look* like? What kind of world does that require and foster? Seeing Bitcoin's worldwide institutional proliferation as the endgame is myopic. It is only the first step of many.

I do want to underscore that the success of Ethereum isn't completely dependent on Eth2.0 (not to say Eth2.0 isn't important ofc).

But between Eth1.x improvements, innovative layer 2 solutions and existing network effects, Eth1.0 is still a major force to be reckoned with!
