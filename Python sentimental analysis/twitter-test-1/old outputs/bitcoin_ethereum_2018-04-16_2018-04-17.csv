Ranges and resistance are persistent across many major markets. But are the S&P 500, the Aussie and Pound the vanguard of a break?

So while I am huge fan of 
@CentbeeWallet
, I want to make sure items on the site are released and ready for use. Also I am not the only decider. We need to put up PR's on the github repo and have people chime in. =)

Ofcourse, no mention of the fact that pre Segwit, Pre #LightningNetwork #Bitcoin still exists, & no it's not ""#BitcoinCash"". #Segwit and LN are backward compatible. onchain TXs still work AND $BCH is also restricted blocksize, 8mb.

""If the node you are trying to pay is offline, you simply can't pay. And you still incur fees when you settle your channels on the restricted blocksize chain.""

Did BitAccess operate licensed ATMs in the US?

Either way, I recall you and Daniel Cawrey approaching me several years ago and asking me: what would it take for me to write an article about BitAccess.

I was never a reporter but a Bitcoin ATM is not interesting. Please block me.
