OK Torch Bearers!  Looks like we can get these stickers made, thanks to @TiKawamoto for drawing it up, looks awesome!  In order to get prices in line we will need to do a minimum of 200 stickers.  We can get delivered anywhere for $3.50 each, pretty good right? #LNTrustChain

Sad to see. I'm hopeful that the Ethereum Community isn't to blame. Unfortunately, there are a lot of opportunists out there.

Bitcoin Cash currently has a 25 chained unconfirmed tx limit. That error message means you have hit that limit. We're going to return a more informative error message in the next release. Also, we're hoping to see that limit removed in a future Bitcoin Cash network upgrade.

Maybe this should be out of scope for Bitcoin core, and instead left as something for wrappers to do, like
