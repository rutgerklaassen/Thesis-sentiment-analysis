‚ÄúThis man wants to see Bitcoin succeed like no other‚Äù

The attacks on him saddened me to think just how hateful people could be. 
This POSM is so malignant! I saw the hatred foaming from someones mouth at my 1st BCH meetup. 

So bring on the Metanet! Let honesty prevail! #BSV

Bitcoin is a network that facilitates value exchange.
Exchanges are recorded in a public ledger, secured by decentralized nodes solving a hash function proving exchanges are valid and competing to earn a reward of Bitcoin.
These ‚ÄúBitcoins‚Äù are the value transfered in the network.

I don't understand why some people are so quick to throw around insults because someone doesn't agree with their views. I've never been called so many obscenities as last year on Twitter all because I was saying bitcoin would go below 6k

Congratulations on your first final, Russell. This was a very special team for you but the difference in experience showed. Like with Bitcoin, you gotta admit it's entirely deserved!

Look at that Bitcoin over there... 

It‚Äôs nesting within its range. 

If we are quiet, we can sneak up on it as it liquidates high leverage traders.

There she goes, stalking her prey as they start to fomo in...
