Wasn't it clear, what Peter was referring to?

His observation is right. The few people I recommended to buy some Bitcoin years ago, who finally opened an exchange account in late 2017 were asking me the exact same question: Why are there different Bitcoin?

The reality is Satoshi mentioned clearly there is only 1 official version and that scaled onchain and had a stable protocol. 
The rules of that protocol and consensus were clearly stated by Satoshi.
In 2017 a controversial move happened, devs took power over BTC, Bitcoin survived

THIS THIS THIS!

Let’s face it the majority simply have no retirement plan.  So why not try this?

DCA weekly buying #bitcoin

Continue for 10 years

That’s it.  Retire in 2029.

Your other choice?  Do nothing and work until you die.

Her response was why are their two Bitcoins? And I said actually there’s a lot of Bitcoins. They’re different versions of Bitcoin who are knocking it off bc they think they can make a better Bitcoin. She was very confused and upset she lost more money bc she bought the wrong one.

this is easy to understand. There are many bitcoin knockoffs but only one Ripple knockoff. Same reason there are many different Rolex knockoffs but very few Seiko ones.

Unfortunately this problem will never be solved as Bitcoin is a movement, not a product. There will never be a leader or authoritative group who can guide newcomers. Bitcoin will survive this and its up to everyone to make sure newcomers survive it too.

And that's exactly what we do.  FYI - no ""bank innovation group"" is trying to shut Bitcoin down.  We are inspired by it, within the constraints of our industry.  And are perhaps more inspired by smart contracts platforms which give us programmable value.  Patience...

http://Bitcoin.org is the first organic result for ""bitcoin"" and ""buy bitcoin"" search terms, and we get a lot of traffic through that, we get much more traffic from Google than Roger's site which doesn't rank as well for search terms. Keep linking to .org, ignore .com.

When Facebook coin launches and hundreds of millions of people start onboarding to Cryptocurrency, they will search Google for Bitcoin.

Roger owns the top search results.

This is a long game threat.

The big block vs. small block battle was a diversion. We should just put that one to rest already. The ""civil war"" was really about a conman who succeeded in tricking the main go-to guy for several businesses when it came to the Bitcoin protocol.
