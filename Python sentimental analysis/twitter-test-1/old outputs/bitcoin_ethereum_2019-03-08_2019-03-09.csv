What your seeing is all crypto devs worst nightmare happening. Now having to face the disgusting waste of 2000 coins devs adding less than zero. It would have been better if they stayed home. Not to mention the unforgivable slandering of a innocent man. Humans with no character.

Their talk at 
@ethstatus
 hackathon last year blew me away, it‚Äôs amazing to see real viable product world use cases gaining traction in ethereum already. Also their main credit identity solutions seem really exciting when it gets close or at least cool as an alternative.

Wellllll kinda, but while there are many flavors of vodka, there‚Äôs only one flavor of Bitcoin (and it‚Äôs not called ‚ÄúBitcoin Core‚Äù. It‚Äôs just Bitcoin).

Other than that, sweet image!

I‚Äôve routinely used ‚Äúsats‚Äù and ‚Äúsatoshis‚Äù for years in various circles and never met someone who didn‚Äôt know what I meant. I don‚Äôt think anyone needs work ‚Äúlearning‚Äù about this. I guess some people don‚Äôt know by heart how many sats in a bitcoin, but google can answer that.
