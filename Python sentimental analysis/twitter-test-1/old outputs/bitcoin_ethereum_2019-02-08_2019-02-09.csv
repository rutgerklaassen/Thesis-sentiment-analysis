Are you actually going to do your research and call him out on lies and whitewashing history? Last time you had him on you let him claim unquestioned ETH was only ever supposed to be for moving value, when in 2014 he himself penned a Bitcoin Magazine article saying otherwise.

It's good to acknowledge that the trust models are different. People need to know what they're getting into. But I wouldn't call them design failures. Just different. That said Bitcoin is of course the gold standard, no doubt.

So what‚Äôs an example of a coin which is mot bitcoin but ok.  Remember its not an equity, so if its Not capable of being money and not a stock, certainly not a bond. What is it. Why should anyone buy it?

Of course an attacker can send arbitrary messages. You do understand Byzantine failures, right? One of the first rules you learn in developing secure software is never to trust your inputs.

Is it OK to drink it, however, if one has just learned that Stanford Hoover Institution economists have drunk/are trying to get others to drink the BitCoin koolaid?
