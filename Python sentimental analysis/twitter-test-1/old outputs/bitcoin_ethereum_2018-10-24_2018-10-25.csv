Remember the golden rule: if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Oct 25, 2018","FWIW, Bitcoin is currently paying out ~$200k in fees a day, or $73mn a year. So it’d have to increase that 68x to get to $5bn. Not sure that’s even possible without scaling.

No. No. No, No, and No. 

It's only true for Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a slowly dying altcoin with a diminishing and infighting community, no unique use cases, no adoption nor usage, and hardly any Github activity.

Wake up, 
@CobraBitcoin
. Don't play stupid.

I remember this one day last year

I haven't left the house in over a week, bitcoin did almost nothing. suddenly a friend asks me out to eat a vegan burger with him

I check price while we're ordering burger -> 1000$ candle move down

I got liquidated so hard it wasn't even funny

Bitcoin never even reached its potential.

Not even close.

Indeed, I could continue working on other paid work instead - I don't *need* to get funding to work on Bitcoin.

But the point of getting funding to work on Bitcoin, is that Bitcoin can now get more of my time spent working on it directly.

Airbitz used to maintain a directory of locations that accepted #Bitcoin. Michigan had a nice sized list, at one point. 2014 was awesome. 
AFAIK, the number is now ZERO. Nobody accepts Bitcoin as payment here anymore.
