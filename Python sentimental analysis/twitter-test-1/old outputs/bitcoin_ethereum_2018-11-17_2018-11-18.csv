Are you unaware that $XRP can be used for more than banking? 
You remind me of the people who wouldn’t shut up about Bitcoin being used for drugs. 
While I try and get you caught up to speed on Twitter, my website is earning XRP in real time. Web monetization is now possible.

This is about Bitcoin.

Chain splits must obviously stop.

But how long must a chain branch live before being considered ""permanent""?

Good luck trying to catch the absolute bottom. Won’t happen. If bitcoin is going to 50k eventually. I’m not worried if I bought at 5k instead of 3k. I will still take short term directional trades. If you aren’t just trying to accumulate btc now for the future you’re missing out.

Not gonna happen. It cost on avg $3.5k-$4k to mine a single bitcoin era and the majority of miners in China said they are not selling for a loss. This news is being issued by the elites on purpose to scare folks to dump so they can pick up as cheap as crookidly possible

Talking about crypto to (older) normies you can feel how wound up and defensive they become. People definitely fear the idea of bitcoin.

Why do you need XRP anyway? People transferred $300 million in Bitcoin (BTC) for a 4 cent fee. And that's without Lightning (VISA's replacement). https://blockchain.com/en/btc/tx/261d69b25896034325d8ad3e0668f963346fd79baefb6a73b4eabd68c58c81ff…

Whoa mayne and I sound the same. You literally cannot go wrong here. Worst realistic case it goes down a bit... so what you got 5500 Bitcoin. If it goes to zero it doesn’t matter if you longed 20k 10k 5.5k or 3k... you’ll be wiped out

Truth is though, that Bitcoin isn’t that decentralized either. It only took a handful of miners in a secret meeting you were part of, to get them to sign the Hong Kong agreement.

It's 1000% a good thing for crypto. Removing these scam ICO's is like saying goodbye to MtGox back in 2014.

Once these STO's start becoming a thing, investors will slowly switch their thinking and understand how powerful #Bitcoin is. 

It is just a matter of time man.
