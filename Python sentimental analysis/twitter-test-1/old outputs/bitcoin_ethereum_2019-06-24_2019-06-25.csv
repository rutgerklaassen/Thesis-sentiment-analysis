If you think there's nothing more outside of Bitcoin then I can say with certainty you're not as smart as you think.

Some of my smartest friends left crypto 

Their reason are more or less similar: there is little thing interesting in next 3-5 years other than bitcoin, and it‚Äôs moving slow, not much they can do, which can‚Äôt be a full time job

Not worried about what bitcoin does, it's time to scale into $alts boys.

Anything $BTC does right now is peanuts compared to what is coming in the next leg up for $MATIC & #Altcoins. 

One week of #altseason pump will wipeout all the bleeding & make us millions in the process!
