Damn! Yeah I had my dealings with them last March. Took them forever to send the money after jumping through hoops. Then when I went to reload they told me all I could do was bitcoin transactions. Then the dude got smart with me on the phone.

You get the one that doesn't need a prefix/suffix. 

You buy Bitcoin, or Ethereum, not Bitcion Super Cash Private, or Ethereum Older Version. 

The one that doesn't need to append words to it's name is the one that won the hashwar. 

This is why its important to list the name

The American medical and pharmaceutical system is the biggest racket out there. 
My 15 year old daughter is attending Harvard Med summer program with the intention of attending full time upon graduation. And she will.
Damn,Harvard is expensive. 
Need Bitcoin over 50k by 2020.

see part 2 of the tweet. yes, ETC is the original chain. but when *most* people say ETH they mean ethereum, the forked chain, which has ERC-20 tokens and conferences and unicorns and vitalik.

Stefan Thomas (Justmoon) was not one of the founders, but was an early developer on the XRPL. He created BitcoinJS. I'd say McCaleb has enough wealth to be sat anywhere he would want with many lambos and wines. JoelKatz wrote early scaling code for bitcoin-core.

Vitalik has done some impressive stuff. I'm even impressed with Consensys' ability to loosely control key narratives. But TEC needs people who can translate to mass adoption, if that's the goal. All these ""Ethereum killer"" chains will find their place, but it's life's work.
