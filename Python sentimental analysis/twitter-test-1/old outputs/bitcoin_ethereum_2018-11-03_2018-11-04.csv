Actually Matt, I think Bitcoin is better for paying for booze. You would wait all night for 3 transactions and you’d go home sober. With XRP you’d be drunk really really fast! J/k.

It’s almost as if Bitcoin maximalists don’t realize that the overwhelming majority of the world does not give a shit about their ideologies or theories, yet they expect the world to bend to them because they are “true”

Who's they? Bitcoin maximalists? YouTube teenagers? Give me a break.  If XRP continues to penetrate the global banking industry, 100B XRPs won't begin to be enough.  You can't use Bitcoin as any metric whatsoever for what XRP will amount to.  Bitcoin ended where it started, a fad

I think there’s a difference between the Bitcoin / Crypto community actually doing / building meaningful stuff in the space and Bitcoin / Crypto Twitter. That’s probably where the disconnect is.

It’s because Bitcoin used to be the only game in town. Now it represents half the crypto market cap. A lot of incoming fiat is going elsewhere hence Bitcoin’s future is less predictable.

1/ I used to be curious about this as well until I started actually contributing towards the ecosystem. What I found is that a ton of resources have been poured into eth scam icos and projects.  Resources that could’ve been otherwise been used to develop bitcoin infra.

I can guarantee you this is ideological. Amaury is the anarchocapitalist. CSW is the one who wants Bitcoin to grow up and integrate with the rest of society. You can live in your imagination all you want but it won’t change the world.

You don’t realize how to win until you have lost it all. Hard work pays off. Crypto isn’t easy. Time is money. I invest time into what I invest in. Plus I have the passion for it. I think you can respect that being passionate about oil recycling.

When anyone says ""crypto"" or ""the public blockchain"", that really means Ethereum first and foremost. Other platforms are at best secondary launch targets.
