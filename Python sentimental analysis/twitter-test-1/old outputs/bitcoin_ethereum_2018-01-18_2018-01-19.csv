Bitcoin grabbed the fork out of its chest and licked the some of the blood off of it. He thrust it into the boy’s chest, banishing him to a centralized network forever. He now just roams twitter saying “I’m Bitcoin”

And that’s the story of Bcash. Now you know what it is.

You still don't get it. Bitcoin is **not worth it**. It is categorically a broken design that will never be a global value transfer system. It is a *failure* at its stated goals. Ditch it already and look into whatever altcoin does things better.

Decentralization neither requires nor is worth a nine freaking order of magnitude overhead. That is just comically bad. The only reason Bitcoin hasn't died yet is due to all the speculation turning it into a game for investors; it's the only thing it's good for.
