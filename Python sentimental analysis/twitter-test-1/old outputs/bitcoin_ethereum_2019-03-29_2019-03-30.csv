You and I think the same Chris.  When Bitcoin makes that run, which it will, alt coins satoshi will get decimated.  Once bitcoin pumps, alt season starts right after.  One of the first coins to lead the alt season is always Doge coin and I have a heavy bag now.

The subjective value of Bitcoin is whatever utility people feel they get from it. Some believe it gives them more control over their own savings, others think speculating on it will make them rich, yet others use it to pay rescuers and information sources in war zones.
