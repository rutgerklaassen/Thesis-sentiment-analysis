Finally, once they have earn tokens or Ethereum by providing value within the app, they have an incentive to be educated about downloading a wallet and protecting their holdings. They've just onboarded into Ethereum without even knowing it.

Monero is extensible! Lightning Network and MimbleWimble sidechain will address scalability. Agree that it’s likely Bitcoin’s fungibility will improve at higher levels.

A user clicks into an app built with this tooling and can immediately start interfacing with it. No buying Ethereum, no downloading a wallet, no learning about seed phrases... straight to providing value within the space of the app itself.

Does anyone know when a person has ""received"" assets from a fork? I can fork the bitcoin ledger a dozen times a day if I want, when did you receive the assets from all my forks?

It will happen.

When Satoshi said version 0.1 of Bitcoin was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime, he meant it;

it's the version that will survive. The only version.

In this Bitcoin is stable.

When people come to realise this, there won't be any uncertainty any more.

5/ ...& back then I was so bummed abt instability & unfairness of the financial system. But in 2012 I discovered #bitcoin & soon realized no one needs to be trapped in the unstable legacy system anymore! There's no substitute for education & I'm grateful for the oppty to help!

Not just women, but all should be encouraged to go to these conferences just to meet people. The amount of knowledge you can gain and the friendships you can build are great opportunities for all.
