I was making a point about Bitcoiners being more adversarially minded than the Ethereum community which leads to Bitcoin being more secure.

* I still believe it's important for ethereum to not be aligned with ""red tribe"" (ie. how bitcoin is portrayed here https://twitter.com/_kevin_pham/status/927795191985012736?lang=en‚Ä¶) but it should also not be aligned with ""intolerant blue tribe""

Perhaps because Bitcoin, for the first time, provides a property right without needing an apparatus of coercion

4/ Imagine a physical good that had a force-shield around it so only the person who owned it could control it. That's what Bitcoin provides in the realm of money.

Why do they need to get filled? 
So what would happen if #bitcoin went bullish now and to 8k without filling these gaps. Then went onto 50k... what dose it mean. What would happen? Why do you think the law states these gaps must be filled?
