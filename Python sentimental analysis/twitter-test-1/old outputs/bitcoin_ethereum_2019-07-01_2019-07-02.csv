Absolutely love Bull Bitcoin. Super easy, non-custodial, good customer support, no BS. Recurring purchases would make DCA even easier.

A lot of whales are invested in it...I.e. crypto exchanges. That is Bitcoin's bread and butter. It isn't utility, it isn't adoption. Whales.

You misunderstand. The 600% premium is towards RTGS, which is the Zim government's fake peg to USD. RTGS is the primary unit of account it the near-ubiquitous mobile wallet in Zim,

yea, i dont really buy one coin to rule them all either, but i see bitcoin’s brand awareness and existing integrations (bitmex for instance) as the moats, rather than its utility as an SoV vs programmable money.
