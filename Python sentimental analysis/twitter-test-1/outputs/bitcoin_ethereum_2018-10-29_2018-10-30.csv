Bitcoin is at the top of human perversities that aim at the creation of totally unreal ""wealth,"" wealth that can disappear faster than it appeared. Those playing this wealth game have never cared about Earth's life-support system. They are on steroids with only one goal: More!

Bear market for bitcoin has been over since February. For alts its been over since August.

This is just a boring flat neutral market for Bitcoin and alts. Alts just have a high dispersion amongst themselves leading to some opportunity.

Lightning Network is basically 0fee by design. But...no such thing as a free lunch: you pay w/ less security than onchain Bitcoin (hot wallets, punishment security model, DDoS potential) & UX (online when you receive, difficult backup, not always trivial to find liquidity paths).

It provides good lessons indeed. Risk management especially but also the power of behavior and herd mentality. Now, I believe the $6,400 Mark is proving that fundamentals matter even in Bitcoin (marginal cost of production roughly ~$6,400).
