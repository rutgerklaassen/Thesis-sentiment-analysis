In the official Bitcoin people and developers have no power over he protocol. The whole point of decentral is that people get no say in what the protocol is.
The power lies in the strength of the protocol to be locked down for decades to come.

Scaling on chain works.

#Bitcoin, uniquely, can scientifically be proven to be money. Not so with fiat. Example: The govt printed trillions of fiat post-2008, without any idea what the results would be, because classical economics is a belief system, not science.

Totally agree that #Bitcoin is a huge accounting revolution! Decentralized, distributed, censorship-resistant, immutable, equity-based, extensible & network effects.

If we celebrated someone else monetizing Bitcoin a year later, Bitcoin may only be $0.25 today. Laszlo jump started something with pizzas and his remaining Bitcoins are better for it. Sometimes your first line soldiers are expendable. It's needed to turn the tides in a war.

No thanks, I prefer to keep my fiat that has depreciated 96% since 1913 & keep that in a bank, which then gives me a generous 1% interest rate.  Dont forget I also help the bank make 25% from my deposits and help the 1% get richer.

Just in case you missed it, that was sarcasm.
