Odds of a cryptocurrency winning: <100%.  Odds of it being something other than Bitcoin: 0%. Diversify out of cryptocurrencies, not by piling shit with Bitcoin.

Why is it a dilemma?  Bitcoin should never be opened up to the general public.  It's nothing more than a pyramid scheme.  The SEC is doing the right thing.  This market crash is just the whales taking a fit, probably trying to get the masses to gang up on the SEC.

While long-term ASIC resistance is futile the #ethereum PoW algorithm ( Ethash) holds up pretty well as it's intentionally designed to make memory bandwidth the bottleneck. https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash‚Ä¶
