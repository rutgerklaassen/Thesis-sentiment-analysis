ZCL forked Zcash and removed the founders fee, then they forked ZCL to ZEN to add the founders fee back. (snapshotted early too so they could dump on us the 1st time)

Then they forked again for P&D rd2 for Bitcoin fork fomo.

They are charlatans, they can't add code, only fork.

I think reasons people don't hold any BTC is more fun.
1.) Can't own a full Bitcoin (whatever that means)
2.) Ethereum is cheaper and has a boy genius
3.)Big blocks are good right?
4.) Dictators are misunderstood
5.)Taxes, it looks like I have to pay more than I made
