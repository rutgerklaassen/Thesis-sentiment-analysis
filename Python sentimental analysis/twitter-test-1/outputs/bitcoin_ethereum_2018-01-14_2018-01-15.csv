They also conveniently ignore the parts of the whitepaper where Satoshi talks about bitcoin being 'digital gold' and 'fees must incentivize' miners.    They also ignore Hal Finney explaining layer-2 networks is how the network will scale.  They are *all* technically ignorant!

I bought a dollar worth of bitcoin at the Lucky Dragon a year ago. I had a pretty smooth experience. I've since lost the fraction of a coin though. Perhaps the fees are only due to the crazy rush cryptocurrency is experiencing.
