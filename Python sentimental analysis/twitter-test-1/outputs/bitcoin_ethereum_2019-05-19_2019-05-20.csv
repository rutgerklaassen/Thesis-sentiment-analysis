What makes Bitcoin a step ahead & anti-fragile is the hard work of Bitcoiners and developers in educating and defending the future of Bitcoin, which is also aligned with value of their hodling. Startup life span tends to be too short term or non Bitcoin aligned operators at times

 are in #contango, per 
@CryptoHayes
. Contango means that the future/forward price of a commodity is higher than the expected spot price at maturity. More on contango: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contango
