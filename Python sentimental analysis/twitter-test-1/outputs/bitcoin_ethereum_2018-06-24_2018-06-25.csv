In roughly 3 years Bitcoin grew by 11,328%

It only makes sense for that type of growth rate to be matched by a correction of at least 1/3 to 1/2 of the time that it grew. Anything earlier than that will result in a harmful ending.

2/ Your math hinges on the need to continually convert to USD (a real problem for something like $XRP), but not $BTC. The entire promise of #bitcoin is that with enough trade in essential goods and services, we create a self-sustaining ecosystem with no need to convert to USD.

So fiat would need to travel into and out of Bitcoin at a rate of $6bn per hour, so north of $50 trillion/year of volume traded (vs a fraction of that today) and you’re concerned about what, exactly? (I’m not saying I agree with your logic train, but let’s play along).

Super interesting! According to price action we're moving slower. But according to this we're moving faster. in my bitcoin theory there's an area of convergence where we either go moon, or hit another low. So maybe if I calculate this speed to see where we land. It may match up
