Leading up to Christmas, why not give yourself the gift of secured wealth?

Take your #bitcoin off exchanges. Store it in a hardware or paper wallet.

https://99bitcoins.com/create-99-9-secure-bitcoin-paper-wallet/‚Ä¶

I lost coins on 4 exchanges, trying to make sure it doesn't happen again.

Join #proofofkeys by Jan 3.

Outside the crypto bubble, people think Ethereum is Bitcoin. It's all Bitcoin, just like every video game console is a Nintendo and every mp3 player is an iPod.
