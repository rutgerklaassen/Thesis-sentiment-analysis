FOMO can go bad in any market , but you missed 30,000% profit since you bashed Bitcoin when it was at $50 and you were making fun of its 30-40% drops praising gold and silver. You can still compare 5 years chart gold VS bitcoin and cry.... Lets see what happens in next 2 years ;)

I think a lot of young developer mindshare has been lost to ETH because of the ETH ICO boom.

However, lightning is attracting lots of devs, and Bitcoin does not have the stigma of the ICO craze - it's almost better that it was compartmentalized to ETH.

ETH ICOs wanted $ not ETH

There are a lot of assumptions in here. It may be that Bitcoin miners are optimizing for renewables. It may be that they are not. Nobody has the data, and optimistic assumptions to the contrary are the ones that require support.

A smart global energy policy is the key - like ""No bitcoin mining from fossil sources and just overcapacities from green energy"". Fighting CO2 is a global policy effort anyway. Bitcoin will still work secure enough and can scale 100x for the future - no problem.

To prevent misunderstanding of 100x growth lets start at the beginning: Technical bitcoin does not need more enegry to process more transactions. The same amount of transactions could be processed today with just one Laptop. More mining is adding more security to the network.
