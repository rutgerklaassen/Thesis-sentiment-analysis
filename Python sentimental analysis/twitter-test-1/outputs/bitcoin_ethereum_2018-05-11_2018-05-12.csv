That's right. My families do not believe this crap. I created wallets for them and give them some bitcoin. This will help them one day. #bitcoin is the Noah's Ark for economic catastrophe.

Love your passion, love you keep people accountable for what they say. And being individually sovereign is the fundamental thesis of Bitcoin. Don’t let these high time preference characters distort the thesis

 Hi David, I appreciate your work on Bitcoin Wiki! Quick question on this graph...is the Y axis mislabeled (ie should be 90%)? https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/File:Consolidation-savings.png…
