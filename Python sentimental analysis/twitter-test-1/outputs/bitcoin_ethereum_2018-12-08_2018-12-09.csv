You compare costs of traditional elecronic money vs bitcoin without doing ""per transaction"" cost. Also: banking system does much more than just money. Real costs of electronic money balances are nil.

Saying bitcoin is going to $0 during a bear market is as ridiculous as saying it's going to $‚àû during a bull run.

Good list but I don't think we should go overboard celebrating 6. We *need* fees to rise if Bitcoin is to remain secure.

It's not really imaginary, the blockspace is real, like cloud storage :). Bitcoin is the currency for both accessing the network and the value of accessing the network. But you can say value is subjective, bur it's very real as long as there is a purpose. It's abstract.

No it's not! People need to form a system of cooperation that is sufficient for the entire world. Splitting is not cooperating. Bitcoin's value is improved by learning to cooperate. UGH just watch my latest video.

Ultimately I think http://ethresear.ch should be folded into http://ethereum-magicians.org as a ""research"" tag or ring. Both are fundamentally concerned with Ethereum's technical governance after all. One forum to rule them all.

It's becoming abundantly clear that there is so much about bitcoin people just haven't seen.  And these tiny fragments of the unseen bigger picture are totalling up.  In perspective, the trivial things people waste so much time arguing on today, are probably long solved using ^^^
