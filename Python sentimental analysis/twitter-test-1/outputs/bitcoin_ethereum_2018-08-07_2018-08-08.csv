All it takes is BTC over 10k for the media to start shouting about it again. ‘Is bitcoin back’ then money will flow again. Very few people own cryptocurrency or are even aware of it. ETF is great.. yes but this market will continue to grow with or without it

2/ “Bot pattern” doesn’t mean much. Most trading worldwide, of most assets, is executed by computers. In this case, it’s probably based on the expectation (held by humans that operate said computers) that a large Bitcoin liquidity event would affect the entire shitcoin market.
