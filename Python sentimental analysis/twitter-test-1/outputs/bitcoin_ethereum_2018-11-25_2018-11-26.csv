Nice analogy. The Swiss franc and gold gain value during periods of increased perceived risk. Bitcoin, although it’s an emerging asset is in the same category.

The guy incorrectly uses the second law of thermodynamics (I worked a couple of years in a pchem lab, so i am sure) to stupidly discuss why his Tesla isn't broken more, and he blocks me.

His 'likes' were mostly from bitcoin types - dont think he is taken seriously.

Bitcoin is not a generic term and refers to a specific, well-known, and deeply-understood thing. Your analogy is false—the real analogy would be someone saying they're selling pizza and instead the buyer gets a bottle of canola oil and two Kraft singles.

there's a lot of smart people focussed on Bitcoin & better tech can be adopted by Bitcoin, so if something secure & better that were found, I expect it would be adopted. bear in mind generally any tech can in principle be adopted, by importing #Bitcoin utxo set into the new code.
