Bull or bear, makes no difference to me. I'm a weekly purchaser of #Bitcoin to at least a 20K price point. This is a million dollar asset that just needs time to cook. Waiting to see how to squeeze an extra 0.001 $btc by timing the market is not worth the effort imho.

In computer security, there is only ever ""Good Enough"". - Perfect does not exist.
All security in Bitcoin is probabilistic. If you can attain solid security with a strong economic margin, you have yourself a resilient system.

That is one scenario. Another scenario is that markets have learned from past two halvings and will front run this time .. imagine you are a hedge fund, institutional investor or just a big whale and want to invest big in bitcoin, would you buy BTC before or after the halving?

Correct, you should not extrapolate too far out into the future. I am willing to do one or maybe two more halvings (and put a third one on the chart for discussion), but not further ... if bitcoin is $1mln then USD has died Zimbabwe style, hence my twitter name ;-)

A more accurate comparison would be between bitcoin addresses and XRP Ledger address/dest tag combos. That said it still doesn‚Äôt tell you much, as BTC addresses are more ‚Äòdisposable‚Äô than XRP ones which have a ‚Äòreserve‚Äô deposit amount to prevent address spam.
