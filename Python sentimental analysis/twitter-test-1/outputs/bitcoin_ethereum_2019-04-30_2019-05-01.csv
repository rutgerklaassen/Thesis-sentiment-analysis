$BTC pumping & alts dumping visualized. 

Generally speaking most alts had positive corr with Bitcoin's moves for the past 5-6 months.  

Relationship changed right after the $1k $BTC breakout.

*cc of $ETH, $LOOM, and $VET used as an example*

These comments aren‚Äôt helpful. Not every resource on the planet is suitible for ETH2. 

UX and education are real scaling problems in Ethereum too. You can‚Äôt have mass adoption if it‚Äôs hard to find information.

Can't believe people still bitching about opensourcing the backend api code (even tho it's planned to be open soon)
