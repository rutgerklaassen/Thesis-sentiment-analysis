That’s kinda silly Cobra. They would be extremely rich but to own anything else they have to sell/trade the Bitcoin for it. So it’s a self correcting problem, if a problem at all.

Bitcoin will spur all types of innovation, including renewables, but not especially renewables. Everything will get more efficient.

Bitcoin is not magically getting some new tech from block one, any upgrades would take an incredibly long time to negotiate for bitcoin, and as far as BTC running on EOS, anyone can make a token call it bitcoin and run it as a token on EOS, it means nothing, it is not bitcoin

Bitcoin is down 5% AH

So, I was just curious if that was the kind of thing 
worth mentioning going forward.  

It’s a very contentious issue
Like abortion and Tesla
