I doubt that Bitcoin can offer a solution to the concentration of wealth; all it can really promise is to prevent people from being able to arbitrarily inflate the money supply to their own benefit.

38:36 store of value is mentioned. To me the most interesting part of bitcoin as money is it's origins. It's not brought into circulation by debt. Debt-free transferable credit is the elephant in the room. Past debt-free monies were extinguished and replaced. Wont be as easy now.
