Do you know how many financial crises we had when we were on the gold standard? The whole problem with the gold standard was that it *periodically* became deflationary and there wasn't any way to inflate it. Bitcoin is *always* deflationary.

Roger hates Bitcoin BTC and Twitter but Twitter is his biggest platform to communicate and he holds a ton of BTC. Can you trust someone that goes against what they themselves preach?

These excuses for BTCs shortcomings are misinformed and prevent Bitcoin development. Ideally a cryptocurrency should be able to handle all transactions for everyone and everything. The one that does will create the greatest value for the least cost & have highest market cap.

It's true

People want insurance and knowing they're in good hands

There is great risk in copy/pasting a key, with many letters, in order to send hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of digital assets

One wrong character and you lose your Bitcoin forever...high risk involved

The mental gymnastics employed when the truth of situations present themselves is quite impressive. “Bitcoin’s not for coffee, use Lightning when it’s ready” was the narrative two years ago... now it’s Lightning’s not for coffee (or pizza)...
