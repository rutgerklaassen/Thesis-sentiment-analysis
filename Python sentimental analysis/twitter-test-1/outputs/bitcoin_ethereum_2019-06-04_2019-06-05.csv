We will be so much more productive.

As a BTC and LN critic, I make it my priority to learn as much about it as I can. 

I want to be proven wrong, but so far I am not convinced. I am also the fund manager for Cyber Capital and we are not invested in BTC, I need to be sure.

I am even going to Breaking Bitcoin ;)

Just so you know, Craig Wright = Satoshi Nakamoto, he worked 20 years on Bitcoin, due to circumstances in 2017 it got hijacked.

Well, I can tell you they're not going to buy bitcoin so they can immediately turn around and spend it. Bcashers thinking this is what normal people do are delusional.

Yup. It's why Bitcoin works and Ethereum does not.

Hi Elon, 
Craig Wright = Satoshi Nakamoto. He created Bitcoin over 20 years, it now has the ticker BSV, it uses predicate script on a stable protocol as envisioned (2009). It does IOT, Edi, smart contracts, tokenisation, yes Bitcoin can do all!

You are missing the rest of the world. Live and lives out of the USA. Where governments pushed inflationary monetary policies reducing the currency value to ashes. Example: Venezuela.
