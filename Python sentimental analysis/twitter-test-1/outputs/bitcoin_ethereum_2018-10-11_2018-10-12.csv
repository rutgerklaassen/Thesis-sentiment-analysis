My chart is 100% accurate. If you want to claim Bitcoin is volatile, say that. But instead you make claims it is down dramatically which is based on what, December‚Äôs high? Picking outliers as your core argument is the definition of ‚Äúfudged‚Äù analysis.

Neither is XRP a security. Scammers and fraudulent ICOs supported by Ethereum and in turn Coinbase are ok?....because it doesn‚Äôt support the narrative that Ripple is ‚Äúbad‚Äù.

I'm curious too. I mean, we still buy a little PM (mostly silver) every now and then, but we're invested way more in few crypto by now. I think it's a sound diversification, and calling Bitcoin ""digital fool's gold"" is ridiculous. Both are sovereign monies, fighting the same war.
