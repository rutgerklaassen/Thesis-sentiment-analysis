1. This tweet demonstrates a complete lack of empathy. How can a 80% stock market crash and housing crash possibly be good for anyone?

2. I'm willing to bet with 80% conviction that in 2025 stocks, housing, and BTC will all be higher than they are today. twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/s…

#DigiByte the best #Blockchain in the world. Fast, secure, dApps, smart contracts, DIgi-ID, Digusign, Digishield. We have it all. We are a better version than Bitocin, a better Ethereum, a better whatever. No other crypto comes close. Research and you will see.

That's a pretty big hope to stake the future of currency on.

If Bitcoin becomes as successful as USD, that would be ~1.7T/21M = 809k/BTC. 
That would mean that the total transactions in a block are roughly $400/transaction if Bitcoin onchain scales 10x and $40 if it grows 100x

.@izakaminska you wrote this on December 7th. Bitcoin futures started trading on the CME just 10 days later. That was its all-time high, just under $20,000. Today it's at $6,400. You were 100% correct.
