1. How can a Twitter account impersonate a cryptocurrency? They are two different things.

2. Examples of me defrauding and misleading? The tweet you quoted links to a factual account of BTC's rising fees with an editorial quip attached. Is that fraud now?

You can use this text at the last page: Bitcoin Cash runs this handle. Bitcoin Cash works on an entirely separate network and separate software from Bitcoin. It's currency is not valid as Bitcoin, and is not transferrable to the BTC network.

Wait till you hear about the censorship on /r/bitcoin and the backstabbing and exclusion of the original core dev which Satoshi left the Bitcoin-qt repo to.
Bitcoins historical drama can compete with all the classics.

So for now Bitcoin is as close to a decentralized P2P cash system as we're going to get. And Blockstream is slowly losing its influence and relevance, Bitcoin is still strong despite their toxic social media abuse and their spreading of pro high fees propaganda.

There are quite a few, can't recommend anyone in particular. Google bitcoin mining calculator and check the top results. The key factor is your electricity cost. And the noise. S9s are insanely noisy, and their quiet cousins not cost effective.

That happened in 2015, a year after the failed blockchain(dot)info attempt at doing something with bitcoin(dot)com. CZ was at the 2014 Miami Bitcoin Conference with BCI as well. That's also when Nic Cary  (then CEO) announced Andreas as Chief Security Officer.

Weird times.

P2P ""electronic cash"" is impossible since to implement a system as close to actual cash as possible, you would need no fees, and that introduces tragedy of the commons disasters in blockchains. You have to accept some level of fees, and right now BTC fees are acceptable.

Eff whoever is running the account, but you don’t see any irony in asking a centralized platform to censor an account to “protect” a decentralized technology? If Bitcoin can’t withstand that then it’s in trouble.

Another question could be: 
Where would Apple be without Wozniak? Or 
Who solved Byzantine Generals Problem or other almost impossible problems that led to the design of Bitcoin? If it wasn't the 1 who coordinated the project w/ the early ideas, where would Bitcoin be today?
