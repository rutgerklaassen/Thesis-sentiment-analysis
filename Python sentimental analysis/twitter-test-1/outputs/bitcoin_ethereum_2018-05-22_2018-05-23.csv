There's a lot of computational power that goes into mining bitcoin, in particular to find little bits of data with certain SHA256 hashes. Instead, would've been great if that compute power were used to solve challenging NP-hard problems. Human progress becomes side-effect of hype

Bitcoin is an energy scavenger.  It consumes waste energy that would go to waste otherwise.  It can also be used to fund new clean energy plants.

I don't think it makes sense to talk about the ""efficiency"" of Bitcoin as a whole. The same number of blocks get mined per day regardless of how little or how much energy is used per hash.
