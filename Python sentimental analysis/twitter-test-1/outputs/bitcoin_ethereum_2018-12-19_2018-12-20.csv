Q: would you donate BTC for Bitcoin education if we set up an Earn page for Bitcoin? 100% to users.

We actually mentioned we were thinking about this in the blog post:
""In the future, we may experiment with other kinds of tasks...For example, there may be tasks paid in Bitcoin""

Cryptocurrencies? Sounds familiar, saw something on Bloomberg once. Need experts like you to educate us who have no idea what a blockchain is...sorry meant Cryptocurrencies. In the mean time I will put my Bitcoin and Ethereum back in the drawer.

1. Scaling both on-chain (UASF, minisketch, etc) & off-chain (LN) are just fine thanks
2. RSK & Counterparty provide Turing complete contracts & Dapps. Counterparty even runs an Ethereum EVM.
3. LN fees are ‚Äúunfairly cheap‚Äù
4. Over 70% of Bitcoin‚Äôs hashrate is sustainably mined

Good for you. Now please compare: a) Percentage of Coinbase tweets (and other PR) mentioning Bitcoin. b) Relative importance of Bitcoin as measured by its technological significance or even market cap.

Disagree. There's a network effect that gives incumbents an advantage. You could have made the same claim about MtGox, but I think untold harm was done to Bitcoin by the biggest exchange (at the time) being run by a malfeasant buffoon. Coinbase is less incompetent/more insidious.

IMO today bitcoin is a useful financial tool really only for those in extreme circumstances. For example, people inside dictatorships, people disconnected from the banking system, or people living under hyperinflation. But this is billions of people.

The first asset you support is ZRX? It's an ERC-20... the E stands for Ethereum. 

The logical move would be ETH and BTC.

My fear is how many people9 Bitcoin, Altcoins to ""crypto"") are going to blunder and lose their supply. People really need to be stressing testing small amounts first and ensuring they know how to implement safe, recoverable storage. Could shade the movement and turn sour. imo
