Excellent.

Seeing as BTC is no longer suitable/intended for payments, it‚Äôs great to see a growing emphasis on Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

Bitcoin is cash!

I think there's too much emphasis on BTC/ETH/whatever ETFs, and not enough emphasis on making it easier for people to buy $5 to $100 in cryptocurrency via cards at corner stores. The former is better for pumping price, but the latter is much better for actual adoption.
