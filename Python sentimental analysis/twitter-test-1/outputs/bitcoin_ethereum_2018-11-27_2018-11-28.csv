Bandwidth. Bitcoin gets by with limited bandwidth as POW is finalized every 10min, certifying a list of only a few transactions. As NANO is realtime, votes must be requested to confirm as it happens. We are working to optimize bandwidth usage.

The dosage of ZANUPF spinning is getting in now .He thought it the phrase 'turnaround economy 'was mathematical formula to use in an economy which operates like a 'Bitcoin' .Selling US $ on the black market is a different industry .Open up Bureau Exchange not Street vendor market

You‚Äôve been bullish since the stone top, always talked about catalysts and pitched dozens of longs including #ethereum at $175 recently yet you are 70% cash?  How is that remotely possible?  Would you mind sharing your numbers with us?

In the case of Bitcoin it doesn‚Äôt matter what they think. In the case of tokenization, ICOs, blockchainy stuff, it‚Äôs all that matters.

This feels like a lifetime ago!
Here‚Äôs a 2014 post describing how the Bitcoin raised from the #ETH presale will be used. 
At this point, there wasn‚Äôt a coin, only a concept. Buyers had their name added to a database. 
Quite a few $XRP holders participated.

Announcement on planned withdrawal from exodus
Now that the first two weeks of the ether sale are over, and over 50 million ETH has been sold, we intend to soon make a transaction to begin using the funds to repay loans and kickstart the process...
