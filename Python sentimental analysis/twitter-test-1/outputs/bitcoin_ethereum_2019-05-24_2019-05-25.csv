I was useless
But not 4 long
My future is coming on
Finally Bitcoiners let me out of my cage
Now its time 4 me to rally 
Cuz Im counting no age
Im tangible
Bet u didnt buy so I command u to
Take the long term view
I‚Äôll make ur savings all manageable

Conversations like this makes you understand more about the economics of Bitcoin, or at least want to.

Yeah like DOGE is still around as a result of that, nobody remembers DOGE chain-freezes of 2014... But, no love for DigiByte :(
Still, joys of open-source, none of us would be here if it weren't for Bitcoin, and our mobile wallets are based off BRD, so gotta take the good & bad.
