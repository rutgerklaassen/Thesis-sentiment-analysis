 Looks, walks, talks very much like an opportunist. He acts much more like a man motivated by self enrichment rather than any other motivation. He should be Called out, every time he Tweets, talks, writes. He has become Bitcoin Judas!

If you own  bitcoin or are interested in #Bitcoin, this is a must listen to interview. It gives flavor to the pre-history as well as inside baseball. Thanks!

The name ‚ÄúBitcoin Cash‚Äù alone is deceptive. Maybe it‚Äôs time to stop playing into their hands? #Bcash

Haha you said ‚ÄúTether‚Äù which just so happens to be literally cryptographically embedded into Bitcoin. I couldn‚Äôt write a better joke, myself.

Loads of information (about 30m worth of reading), however, it is written easy enough for anyone to understand.

This is rationalization. They‚Äôre holding an empty gun to Ethereum‚Äôs head in doing that. I don‚Äôt know if they have the desire to tempt fate. They also have investors to answer to, many of which have other portfolio holdings with interest in mainnet Ethereum‚Äôs success.

Makes sense. Later too there was even a PR campaign that took my words out of context to suggest that I was an ‚Äúinflationist‚Äù trying to increase the coin supply, even though I was strongly against doing that.  Bitcoin politics are nasty.

I don't fear a split as much as a devaluation of Ethereum (not just ETH). I can't defend a ledger mutation unless the network's existence is threatened. From my perspective, you're asking for new ETH to be printed after accidentally burning some. It's a very slippery slope.
