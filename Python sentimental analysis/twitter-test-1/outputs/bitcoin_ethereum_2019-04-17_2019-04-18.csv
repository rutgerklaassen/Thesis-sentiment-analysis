Remove ""Bitcoin"" from the name then. #Litecoin has been there since the beginning (2011) but never tried to usurp Bitcoin's branding power.

Even without UTXO commitments, you can sync a pruned full node using about 10 GB of traffic by just rsyncing the ~/.bitcoin/ folder from an already-synced-and-pruned node that you own. No CPU/RAM/disk thrashing. 10 minutes and you're done.

Bitcoin is only secure if 51% of the hash is not colluding to attack the network. The reality is if world governments really wanted to stop bitcoin, they could (or at least push it underground).

The best strategy is to grow really fast and get bitcoin into many people's hands.
