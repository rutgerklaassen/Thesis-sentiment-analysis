I wouldn’t be surprised if Bitcoin would still be over 15k!

Once the money pro's decide to isolate and find the best alt-coin's to invest in( with real-life applications, blockchain), Digibyte will be on the top of their list, then we launch! Bitcoin will always be there as a store of value, but Blockchain app's is the future, not coins.
