Bitcoin is FUD-agnostic. 

After 3 consecutive downward adjustments, the longest downward adjustment streak in history, Bitcoin's PoW difficulty is now up 10%.

How beautiful.

Bitcoin is the money of enemies, the soundness of the money doesn't benefit from group hugs. Therefore, calls for unity, civility, a kinder community, etc, are all grossly misguided when it comes to Bitcoin. Such concepts are used to control others' behavior. #intolerantminority

First certificate of deposit on the blockchain. Trustless interest. Pay holders instead of miners. No Satoshi (if he doesn't claim in 50 weeks) or gox dumping on you. No inflation bug possible like bitcoin has had. Unit bias fixed. Higher tps. More distributed. Whale penalty, etc
