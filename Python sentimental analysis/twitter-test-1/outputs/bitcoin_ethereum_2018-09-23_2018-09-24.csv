If you have to login to an exchange to see ""your"" balances, the exchange controls the private keys to those balances, not you. #Bitcoin is a bearer asset. The exchange bears ""your"" coins, so except for the extent you trust them to send them to you when you ask, they're not yours.

Bitcoin maximalist ignorance at it‚Äôs finest. Such narrow mindedness is not healthy. Not all Muslims are terrorists, not all priests rape kids, not all vegans hypocritically own cats and not all Alt coins are scams.

Heterogeneity arguably saved the Ethereum blockchain back during the 2016 DoS wars ( https://ethnews.com/ethereum-continues-to-suffer-from-ddos-attacks‚Ä¶ ); what stopped geth did not stop parity and vice versa, so the network was online all the way through.

It‚Äôs important that we don‚Äôt set a much higher regulatory burden for Bitcoin/digital assets than other asset classes. At the end of the day, markets participants will have to implement/pay for excessive burdens. Well-intentioned ideas on paper are often a nightmare in practice.
