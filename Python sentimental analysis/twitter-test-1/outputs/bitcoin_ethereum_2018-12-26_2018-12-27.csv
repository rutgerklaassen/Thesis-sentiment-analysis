Either Bitcoin dies or the KYC/AML Surveillance Companies die. You cannot, and will not have both. Your choice now is to pick one side, and then either go down in flames or change the world for good and make a fortune doing it. We choose the truth over lies, progress over fear.

Everyone hates on Coinbase but them going out of business would set bitcoin infrastructure way back and price would most likely be in the shitter for years.  If you don’t like them don’t use them, but I don’t see how a bankrupt coinbase helps us

There is another option, that you believe that Bitcoin was never actually the ""God"" of cryptocurrencies and it can be toppled like any other false god.

That means that in the future, these companies will literally have no purpose, because by the current thinking, all Bitcoin will be tainted. There is no way around this; fiat thinking will die in the Bitcoin world, and ""Blockchain Surveillance"" is fiat thinking. GAME OVER.
