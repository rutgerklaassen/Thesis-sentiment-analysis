LN wallets send each other perfectly valid bitcoin TXs, without miners or any other 3rd party involved. Truly P2P. So besides storing private keys, LN wallets also store Bitcoin TXs, which can't be double spent thanks to time lock contracts, which are enforced by the blockchain.

The addition of PolkaDot gives them a way to progress things more on their terms. 

What is short sighted is that they will deal with the same things Ethereum had to grow thru for the next 2-3 years, plus some unforeseen problems.
