Market analogy version: if you offer a fair price (tough questions, accurate unvarnished background context explanation) they won't sell (won't talk to you). So there is asymmetry where they get neutral coverage, gain reputation are enabled to increase structural risk to Bitcoin.

Buy the dips because we want to move up in a 2 steps forward,1 step back fashion so we trap shorts & keep the RSI & MACD from not getting out of control. They say never sell a dull market, if Bitcoin just kept grinding up a wall of worry, it would be crash proof. Tortoise>Hare
