Yes, single wallet Stonewall is a form of fake coinjoin and looks like a something I should add to my scripts for Bitcoin Core. Already have one that emulates JoinMarket's behaviour there.

We're fully committed to being as much Ethereum-compatible as possible.  Among other things, the usage of ETH in our system will be highly encouraged.

We'll soon be starting a community discussion about this and several other important topics. Would you like to participate?

Is it really a problem? So most people will use Coinbase, Binance, CashApp or the other 100 solutions where end users don’t have to secure their own keys.

Bitcoin is about optionality and freedom, not shaming users with “not your keys...”

God no. Many have tried to do airdrops and hope that people's need for money will drive adoption - but weak money isn't sticky - people just get rid of it and buy real bitcoin (or food).
