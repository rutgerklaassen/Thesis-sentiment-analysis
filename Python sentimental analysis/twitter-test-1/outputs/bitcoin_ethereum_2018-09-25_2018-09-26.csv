If Bitcoin is anywhere near as successful as we expect, the overt and invisible attacks on devs will get crazy. For example, if Iran, Russia, Venezuela uses bitcoin to avoid sanctions. Ossifying level 1 protects devs and protocol. (Not talking about layer 2)

Regardless, it's misleading information. And anyone new to crypto has no clue what the heck a ticker symbol is or the difference between BCH and BTC or Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash, when the site clearly reflects Bitcoin in it's domain. They intentionally make it unclear

1. I never said Ethereum had a protocol bug that directly cost millions. So keep waiting.

2. Choices at protocol level hugely influence behavior at contract layer. My point is that Ethereum's choices at protocol level are why there are so many disasters at the contract layer.
