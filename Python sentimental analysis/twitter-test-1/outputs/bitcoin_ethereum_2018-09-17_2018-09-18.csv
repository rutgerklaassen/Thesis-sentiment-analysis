How do you quantify the usefulness of Litecoin as a Bitcoin testnet with real value? Activation of SegWit on Litecoin disproved a ton of FUD and paved the way for activation on BTC.

I follow for Bitcoin because I consider you to be an expert in that field. 
But I struggle to reconcile how a man of (computer) science can throw all rationale and logic aside when it comes to religion, and it damages your credibility a little.

Ok rookie here.....when you say ""DigiByte is used"" do you mean they use the DGB coins as a payment or fee for use on the blockchain like the ERC20 token is used on ethereum? So you would need to own DGB to operate? Thanks very much for your time.

Honestly man just do what I'm doing. The new cards aren't that better than the 1080 and 1080ti so I'm buying a 1080ti when all the Bitcoin miners dump em off so theyll be fairly cheap and the 1080ti is a beast

Bitcoin crashing to 4.5k would be a massive risk off move and alts would crash. Certainly we can have an alt season without bitcoin moving up first, or even declining somewhat, but not during a huge risk off move.

 Explained how the alert system was removed from Bitcoin Core. Could the mining nodes signaling be removed as well? Are there any risks?
