Absolutely. Interest payments directly in Bitcoin. Royalties. Dividends. Profit-sharing. Referrals. Reward and  program payouts. Court settlements. Paid back from friend for a loan. People need to *earn* Bitcoin,  by their capital, labour, time, skills, value creation

You seem to be ideological driven... and this will color all your charts. The chartist should be pragmatic not doctrinaire. Decide what you want to be - a fanboy for Bitcoin Maximalism, or a chartist. You can not be both.
