It doesn't matter. Orphaning of blocks is how bitcoin is suposed to work. Once your transaction is in the mempool of all miners it's a done deal. The reorg doesn't affect users at all. Just might mean you get confirmed quicker than expected or go back to unconfirmed temporarily

It is trustless. If you don't get that, then you probably don't yet have any bitcoin either?
When you understand it a little better, then you also understand that there is no 'institution' there is concensus, and that concensus is derived from a vast userbase.

In practice, the individual decisions about which side of the fork is the real Bitcoin are made before the fork actually happens / is traded on a market.
