It's truly time we stop giving bcash this level of thought. Dogecoin is 3x it's volume for crying out loud... Every tweet we make bashing them can only be seen as validation that they're still competing with bitcoin at this point.

LN is 100% reserve to the same level of confidence as raw Bitcoin. The second layer we should be concerned about is exchanges, which have been fractional reserve in the past (and some may be today), not LN.

We support Dapps, though, via MetaMask now and mobile-first support later this year.

Also, we use token on blockchain (Ethereum) to pay users to browse (not other way around, but users can goodwill-supplement). That is not possible with fiat or maincoins, absent 9 digit charity,

I don’t know what’s right, but changing PoW seems risky to my pea brain.
