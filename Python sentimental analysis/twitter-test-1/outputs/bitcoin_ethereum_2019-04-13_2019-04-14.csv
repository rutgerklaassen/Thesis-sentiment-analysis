Bitcoin is more than its physicality as a protocol/networked system--It's built on knowledge. Minimizing the physical form makes access to/use of that knowledge more configurable/extensible/portable. Opendime is a good example of off-chain BTC usage. Computation is cybernetics.

IIRC those efficient STARK hashes are built over binary Galois fields. Replicating that in a SNARK circuit wouldn't be particularly more efficient than replicating your average bit-manipulation-based hash function.
