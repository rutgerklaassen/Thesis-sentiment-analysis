You tell me the problem and I’ll tell you the token. 

1. Fiat is a gauntlet for government control: Bitcoin

2. Fiat cannot be programmed to satiate all the desires of mankind: Ethereum

If Fiat is worth $90T+ without having any commodity/industrial/use-value, then why can't Bitcoin? 

We as humans can collectively subjectively and game-theoretically decide what can be our money.

Mises even argued that Gold's industrial premium made it less than ideal.

This is how I like to think about it.
Imagine the Internet is a country.
Bitcoin is the Internet's Fiat, but perfectly strict!
No capital controls.
No taxes.
No inflation.

It's also worth noting that there is no correlation between ownership and addresses. Anyone that is wealthy in bitcoin, but has a good wallet and sense of privacy, probably has hundreds or thousands of addresses under his control.

These issues are not due to inherent properties of Bitcoin, but to the way certain people treat it. Russia similarly makes it hard to use foreign currencies which does not make them less relevant in principle.

2/ The fiduciaries of “real-money” investors are the key to attracting new buyers properly-their demand is real. The rehypothecators bring demand but also create artificial supply-via #bitcoin substitutes that aren’t backed by real #BTC. That suppresses price for real BTC

3/ The SEC & policymakers could also help by not forcing #bitcoin into the custody rule, which wasn’t designed for digital bearer assets that are already allocated, and allowing tech to fulfill some of its rqmts.

I don't think you have a solid understanding of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is censorship resistant, verifiable, and immutable. Decentralization is just a means to an end - it's not the goal.
