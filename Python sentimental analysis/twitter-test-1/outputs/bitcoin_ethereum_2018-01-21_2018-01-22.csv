2. Are they press/hype, or shipping code?

 you crazy kitty, stop coughing up hairballs on #Bitcoin’s PoW to sell PoS. The vast majority of electricity consumed by mining, even in China, is renewable. Why? Because renewables are the cheapest.

Mining a single Bitcoin requires as much electricity as the average American household goes through in two years. Virtual currency aficionados debate if that is a good or bad thing. https://nytimes.com/2018/01/21/technology/bitcoin-mining-energy-consumption.html…

Fastest way to lower fees is to lower the price of Bitcoin. Probably not a popular option, but fees would be much cheaper if Bitcoin were $300 again. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

Electricity use isn't ""intensive"", it's proportionate and never unreasonable if the consumer is happy with the result of the consumption. Comparing total Bitcoin mining consumption to a 3rd world country is irrational; countries don't use electricity in aggregate as a class.

Sorry to be semantic, but it's subjectively false because you believe that the other path is the ""real bitcoin"".  

There is no right answer given that people want different, sometimes diametrically opposed things from the protocol.  If you mean ""Most Popular Bitcoin"" then yes.
