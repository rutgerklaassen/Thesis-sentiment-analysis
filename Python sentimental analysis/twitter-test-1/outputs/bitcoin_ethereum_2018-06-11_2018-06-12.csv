It's like SmartCash using the Bitcoin whitepaper because it's Bitcoin based just like most of the coins using Bitcoin code out there. Having a whitepaper isn't really necessary if we're talking a Bitcoin based coin. Many Bitcoin based coins have whitepapers for the wrong reasons.

Madoff was espousing fake returns and not even making investments with the cash.

Bitcoin has a transparent price, even if it *is* manipulated somewhat and most agree there are only 21 million possible Bitcoins.

Even if Bitcoin crashes, it's not the greatest Ponzi scheme

There is no economic incentive to act maliciously on the XRP Ledger. And if someone is acting maliciously it is plain to see and they can be excluded. Simple. With Bitcoin I don't have that choice.

The burden of proof should be on the accuser. I have seen no evidence of Blockstream's supposed conflict of interest when it comes to bitcoin investors. I have seen Blockstream's CEO at the time of the AXA investment offer a huge bounty to anyone proving a conflict of interest.

Yes. Possible exceptions could be non-custodial assets different from Bitcoin. Digital collectibles (not very interesting but realistic) or consensensus-enforced rights to bitcoins depending on complex conditions (not very realistic right now, but potentially very interesting).

Not to mention that in Bitcoin miners have an economic incentive to behave properly, there is absolutely no such incentive in the Ripple system, and absolutely no opportunity cost that will result in a tangible loss for acting maliciously.
