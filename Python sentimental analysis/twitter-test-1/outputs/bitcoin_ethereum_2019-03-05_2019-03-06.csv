"" I currently hold Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether."" welps. Then looking at his twitter you can see he wrote 2 negative articles about XRP consecutively. Probably another paid anti-xrp shill. We can ignore and feel confident that all this FUD is a sign of the bull for XRP

This is one of the biggest lies that big blockers make, that Bitcoin used to be instantaneous. It was never instantaneous

Deciding what to implement and deploy is the Ethereum governance process, and it largely rests on getting community support for something - because you can write all the code you want, but it does you no good if users don't want to run it.

That aside, what I wish people would understand is that EIPs are *not* the Ethereum governance process!

If you 'take over' the EIPs process and standardise something unpopular, all you end up with is an unpopular standard. You still have to get that implemented and deployed.

The EIP Process does have an accidental aspect to it. The origins are the Python improvement process, copypasta'd to create the Bitcoin improvement process, copypasta'd to create the EIP process. EIP-1 recently went through some upgrades, to reflect what is actually happening.
