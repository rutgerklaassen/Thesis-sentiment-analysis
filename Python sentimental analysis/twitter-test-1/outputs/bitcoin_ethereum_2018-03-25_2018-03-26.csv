This could work with state channels well. Put your annual subscription total in the channel and the provider withdraws every month. 

I don't know enough about what happens when one party wants to close out and the other doesn't though.

Perhaps a few students got interested and started working on it, which in and of itself is cool. 

Bitcoin had also already been established to an extent and had a longer term market value, so it's not entirely analogous to airdrops of new coins.
