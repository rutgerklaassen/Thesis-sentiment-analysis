I think he’s saying fund transfers will still happen in Ethereum but many transactions require no funds transfer but would still require the user to own ETH to pay gas. This lets nonfunds related use cases to happen without the user owning any ETH at all. Solves cold start prob

Yes^ + unlike bitcoin or ether, where the success isn't dependent upon any particular entity but token users and developers contribute to the value of the system, with XRP, its success depends on Ripple getting banks & FIs to use it. An XRP holder can't convince a bank to use XRP

How is that centralisation..? If it would only cost $1MM to get XRP listed on Coinbase - hell, there are hundreds of individual XRP holders who‘d each be happy to pay the entire bill. Would be the same with Bitcoin, if it wasn‘t already on Coinbase.

The comments of that Tweet prove we're in a simulation. It's like a copy paste of every bitcoin discussion ever. Do they actually think they are re-hashing things people don't yet know? Does either side think they are going to convert the other? They are all NPCs.

The Core devs took the tools of the revolution and gave them to the people who need them least. Samson has said that Bitcoin isn’t for the third world. That is a massive departure from the ethic of just a couple years ago when we were building a better future for everyone.
