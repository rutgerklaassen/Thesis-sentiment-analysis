Do you actually understand any of this? I feel like I'm wasting my time.  ASICBOOST is an optimization that works because it makes assumptions about the very, very, *specific* layout of a bitcoin transaction.  If the format of the transaction changes, the optimization no longer..

the same miners that mine segwitcoin mine bitcoin cash, and china is beginning to regulate to a greater extent.  

small blocks made it all about cheap electricity, whereas bitcoin was origionally about cheap electricity _and_ network bandwidth.

small blocks centralized bitcoin.

Not quite.

It wasn't meant to but things you couldn't but with credit cards. It's the blockchain technology that bitcoin introduced. This technology is revolutionary - and will advance society in numerous ways.

The dollar value is a secondary feature, not the prime driver.

I don't think anyone would complain if it was the bronze of #Bitcoin. It's a fork of #Litecoin but it also has better technology so you could almost argue it's above those two (in terms of advancements in tech).
