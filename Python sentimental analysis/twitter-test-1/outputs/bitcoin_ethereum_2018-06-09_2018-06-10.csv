Keep in mind that the ultimate safeguard in all these systems are humans.

If SHA-256 was ‚Äúbroken‚Äù tomorrow in a way that compromised Bitcoin, it would be up to the humans to fix it.

Your magical algorithm that makes all the decisions would be no different.

Bitcoin was discovered deep in the heart of the Andalusian mountain range, miners from the world over descended to extract its uncreated naturally occurring properties. They soon discovered it had come from the moon. They drive it home in lambos longing for a better  world.

Decentralization, private property, individual liberty, and contracts is what capitalism is all about. Not socialism.

Fiat and central bank printed is not capitalist or free market. It‚Äôs centralized, statist and over-regulated, politically controlled markets.

Others tried to explain to you over several tweets how it's not just ""longest chain wins and all is happy"".

If a persistent chain split happens, that is pretty disruptive not to mention damaging to the credibility of Bitcoin Cash.

You don't seem to acknowledge this possibility.
