Zoom out, currently ranging between $3,600 to $4,200

If Bitcoin pushes up, I don't see it closing above the weekly resistance near $4,700 and that's my short position

A drop would restest Weekly MA which has held $BTC price (break below weekly MA is bearish)

The weird part is that there is nothing in the design of Ethereum that prevents it from being a crypto-currency. But perception is key, and somehow a critical mass of people are convinced that success for Ethereum can *only* come from that initial narrative.

The weird part is that there is nothing in the design of Ethereum that prevents it from being a crypto-currency. But perception is key, and somehow a critical mass of people are convinced that success for Ethereum can *only* come from that initial narrative.

And yet, I've seen so many people pigeonhole it as a ""Dapp"" platform.

The DeFi narrative for Ethereum has had some wind in its sail recently and might help people understand that smart contract ""platforms"" are cryptocurrencies first.
