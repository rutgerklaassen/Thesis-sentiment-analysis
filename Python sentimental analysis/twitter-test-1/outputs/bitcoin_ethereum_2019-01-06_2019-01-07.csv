Counting satoshis makes the oppertunities more obvious. It is more adoption friendly and it makes more sense with Lightning network. 

Help me on my mission - a bitcoin maximalist mission.

This perspective helps demonstrate the best functions of bitcoin.
Being able to send 1 cent across the globe FOR FREE. This is a political and economical game changer. 

I guess its just matter of time before we se smart people taking advantage of this feature.

I've always thought you seemed like a super good person and for a time I accumulated LTC. That being said I sold all my LTC this year for Bitcoin, and that was not out of ideology. It was a selfish, financial calculation I made because I don't see an enduring reason for LTC.

This argument is a fallacy, as you could say everything is a useless waste by this measure. He fails to talk about what bitcoin is, represents and is all about. I wonder if he knows anything about it at all. Asking for something to be banned that you don't understand is foolish.

b) Ethereum should work on stuff that does not lead to a cartel -> hopefully POS

Chain reorganization is a client-local phenomenon; the entire Ethereum network doesn't ""reorganize"" simultaneously. It would be more likely that someone discovered all of coinbase etc nodes and 'surrounded' them

If we don't like network value, happy to use other aggregate metrics (txn value? hash rate? dev #? addresses? users? trading volume?) & look at #Bitcoin dominance relative to those metrics over time too. My hunch is the majority are all declining (I say that as a $BTC bull)

Yes, Ripple are working with regulators. As you say, there is no ""Bitcoin labs"" and so far seems very few in the Bitcoin world want to step up to the task. They think if they stick their head in the sand another 10 years that something different will happen from the past 10.
