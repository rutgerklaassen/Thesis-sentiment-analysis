BitCoin is to money what Facebook was to socializing. It is going to be HUGE!
Firstly, let me frame this with the following statement:- I bought more than 200BTC when its value was 232USD/BTC. It is now worth more than 750USD/BTC. Think about that, in under 2 years it tripled...

Bitcoin was created to be a decentralised peer to peer cash system. Which it has failed to realise. In fact XRP is actually better suited to that than Bitcoin is. “It is just a matter of time” is not a sound strategy if you a building on an unsuitable foundation.

Not necessarily. Since there shouldn't be a split, there should still be only one Bitcoin BCH that everyone will continue using after the fork. That should be Satoshi's Vision Bitcoin BCH.

I'm not sure that last part is necessarily true. Perhaps I'm impatient, but look at Bitcoin: Highest market cap, yet adoption basically on par with 5 years ago. That is unless you subscribe to the greater fool's store of value theory of course.
