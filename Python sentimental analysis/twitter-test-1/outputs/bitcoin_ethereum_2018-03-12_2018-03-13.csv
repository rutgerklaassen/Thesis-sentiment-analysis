Bitcoin is not an organization. It does not have a website, a twitter or policies. It's a peer review open source project that is trying to scale bitcoin the most efficiently and effectively.

This may be true at the ICO layer but it's absolutely false at the protocol layer. In ethereum alone Casper, sharding, state channels, ewasm, plasma, formal verification and many other areas are incredibly innovative and ambitious.

Giving up your Bitcoin now is like giving up a top-level domain name in the early 2000's.

Worth less than a couple years previous, but just a fraction of what it worth now.

Except there are way fewer bitcoins than domain names.
