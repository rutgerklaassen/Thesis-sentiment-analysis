My goal is to accelerate the adoption of Bitfi wallet. Doing so eliminates archaic institutions and replaces the need for untrustworthy exchanges like Hitbtc. The world will not accept cryptocurrency until we can access and safely store our funds. http://Bitfi.com

Rpi 3 is good enough to run a full node. You need an external hard drive to manage the blockchain.
I am running one myself.

It came up in my BIP65 CheckLockTimeVerify: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki#Detailed_Specification‚Ä¶

That's why BIP65 specifically deserializes up to a five byte integer rather than the four bytes that are usually the limit. (Note there's overhead in how Bitcoin serializes ints)
