Your spoiler is a bit too simplistic and one-sided. They say correction could come if price bubbles up again without fundamentals: ""If Bitcoin price continues growing further without advancing growth of DAA, there might be another bubble (and another correction) on the horizon.""

You have to hoard because of some reason that you think more people will join you. If all you are is a robot that hoards bitcoin then there is no real reason to expect people to imitate you. I didn't think people were that stupid when I wrote the article that I had to say that.

Bitcoin wasn‚Äôt broken 2009-2017 but sure is now, thanks to an intolerable minority.

There is no mainstream for BTC, it‚Äôs self defeating with 1mb blocks, $1-$XXX fees and 10min-Xdays conf times.

2nd layer adoption will face entirely new constraints, incentives & effects.
