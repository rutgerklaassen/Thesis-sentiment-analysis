 At this moment Bitcoin will probably retest the pennant bottom that is also SMMA 200 and fibonacci target. So i would say that #Bitcoin  might fall to 6.3-6.7K area in the next days/weeks. Indicators are also bearish confirming another wave down for #BTC.

Yes, it should have only one choice with the real bitcoin that originally had low fee and fast transactions, which one? 
@Cointelegraph
 also should write a detailed analysis on how bitcoin is far away from the satoshi white paper, showing the differences, don't you think?

Until Bitcoin existed governments had sole ability to *enforce* the sovereignty of their currency by the point of a gun. The sovereignty of a cryptocurrency is enforced by mathematics and bootstrapped with decentralization (all systems migrate towards centralization).

But banks are the problem. The housing market and bitcoin are both ponzi-schemes, yet the bitcoin may end soon whereas the housing market will continue forever. Get a high morgage, hope your house rises in value to cover the costs.
