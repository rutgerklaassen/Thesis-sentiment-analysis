some months ago i said i would call the bottom of bitcoin when i read a tweet from @pierre_rochard against it. 

maximalists after many years find it very hard swallow their pride and acknowledge anything against bitcoin: ideology goes always against intellectual honesty.

#Cardano at $.04, #Decred at $16, #Bitcoin at $3450. Feels great investing in assets that you are confident are undervalued.

@pierre_rochard
 block now is probably the best alternate signal to call a bottom according to my theory of expecting capitulation content from maximalists.. it is no coincidence at all this happens with bitcoin at ~$3300.

good news is we might be close to the bottom.

I could tolerate a lot more about this stuff if PoW goes firmly in the bin

basically I'm waiting for Ethereum to go PoS so there's an example to take to legislators

You are literally hosting a hitpiece on Bitcoin and then claim it's to ""go for dialogue"" like that's any bit different from going for clicks

You are doing this in the year that starts off with major news outlets getting reduced and doing layoffs for cannibalizing their fields...

Congrats! But I’m confused, shouldn’t there be a visual interface somewhere where you can select how much you want to donate and it shows what match it will generate? Because it’s a lot more complicated than “pledge $10 and recipient gets $20”
