They told people in july 2017 that predicted 10k in december that they where insane. It went to 20k.

More than 80% of bitcoin's token distribution is already done. It's already too late to hope it will decentralize token distribution.

Millions of dollars a day of value created by the bitcoin ecosystem is going to electric companies and ASIC manufacturers because of PoW. That's value that a better design could have kept in the bitcoin ecosystem.

It is a shame Bitcoin community didn't just adopt using the XRP Ledger to trade Bitcoin IOUs on rather than try and build Lightning, which just seems doomed to fail. They could have had faster payments working years ago.
