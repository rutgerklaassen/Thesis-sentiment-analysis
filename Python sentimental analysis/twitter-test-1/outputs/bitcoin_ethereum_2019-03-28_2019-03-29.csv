#Bitcoin utilising 26-period EMA as support, with the line moving closer to the 200-period MA.

Last time the 26-EMA crossed up above the 200 was in Oct, 2015 and saw the build-up to crypto's 2017 bull run.

Wasabi is similar in its approach. They use Chaumian CoinJoin, while CashShuffle is based on CoinShuffle. Wasabi has done good work, and are similar in many ways, but the way they actually do the obfuscation is different. Also it's BCH or Bitcoin Cash.

I think that’s exactly the point—things that in the Bitcoin mindset would be “new features” that need to be bikeshedded on bitcoin-dev, implemented by core devs, and adopted in a soft-fork, are often just another contract on Ethereum

I think dapp and ICO skepticism has led many Bitcoiners to underestimate the usefulness of having a flexible layer-1 platform for verification of arbitrary protocols. Bitcoin Script isn’t very good at verification! It can’t even check a Merkle path, or a signature on data.

Blockchain Commons is working on a proof-of concept reference implementation of an air-gapped iOS bitcoin wallet. It uses an iPod Touch or old sim-less iPhone that is  administratively-locked network disabled to create keys & sign transactions, and only communicates via QR codes.
