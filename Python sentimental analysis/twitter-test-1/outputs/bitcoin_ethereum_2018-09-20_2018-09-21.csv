Xlm isnt even an XRP competitor. But yes Ethereum's days are numbered. Cardano and stellar have that chance to over throw Ethereum

But Bitcoin was a new idea. The Proof of Stake stuff isn't really new ideas, just layers of obfuscation and tradeoffs on the same old crap, with the minor exceptions of random beacons and fixing quorum by requiring a supermajority, neither of which can replace Nakamoto consensus.

Bitcoin uses proof of work in a novel way, but PoW wasn’t novel. It was used in Hashcash. The new parts of Bitcoin weren’t the work function.

Good point but disagree. My only issue with Satoshi's immaculate conception and near perfect foresight was not taking into consideration that ""soul in the game"" is a stronger incentive than ""skin in the game"" and he choose a too aggressive issuance schedule to bootstrap Bitcoin.

I agree actually! I often wonder how Bitcoin would have developed differently if we were only at, say, 50% issuance a decade on
