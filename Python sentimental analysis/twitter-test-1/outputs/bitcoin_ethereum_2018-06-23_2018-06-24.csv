If you bought any time before that you have made a lot of money. None if this is new. If you bought a $20k bitcoin but didn't buy a $6k bitcoin, then you shouldn't own any bitcoin.

If you don't have a time horizon measured in years, instead of months, you shouldn't own bitcoin.

The fact that no one can arbitrarily seize and return money IS more secure. What do you think happens when a nation state orders BPs to take your money or censor your transactions? They can try to do that in Bitcoin or Ethereum, but it is incredibly costly and likely to fail.
