The crypto party should have much more unicorns and fairy dust, probably more fun. The Bitcoin party will have beer, wine, meat and a bunch of dudes talking Austrian economics and lightning experiences

Bitcoin's miners aren't ""network owners."" The owners are people who control UTXOs. Miners are servants and exist only as service providers for people who own bitcoins.

The block reward and fee market exist as a carrot-on-a-stick to keep them motivated to do more for the network.

Unfortunately price has been linked to other assets Bitcoin in particular. Dash is always focused on development/innovation/adoption & not on trading/marketcap. Price follows fundamentals

Proponents of this view would also welcome attacks on things they like (e.g. Bitcoin).

Bitcoin gets stronger with each attack (bcash, segwit2x). Ethereum gets more centralized with each attack (DAO --> chain rollback).
