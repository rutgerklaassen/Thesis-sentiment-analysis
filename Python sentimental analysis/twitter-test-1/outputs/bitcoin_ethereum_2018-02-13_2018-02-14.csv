No honey. Bitcoin Core is a software implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, which is mostly used as the reference for other implementations. There's no coin/ledger/cryptocurrency/network named Bitcoin Core. The network is Bitcoin (BTC), the software is Bitcoin Core/Electrum/etc.

Bitcoin Cash rebranding to Bitconnect Cash would be epic. It would reduce  confusion and allow the coin to stand on it's own merit. There's certainly a place for competition in scamming solutions with propaganda and brand hijacking.

Bitcoin Core is the software, Bitcoin is the currency. This is the reason Roger used it. Since its a term defining a software component of BTC, it creates confusion into thinking it's the legit name, and not a way to try and define Bitcoin as equal to Bitcoin Cash or other forks

Also note that if Bitcoin Core changes that code, that changed code *doesn't* become Bitcoin by default. Additionally, that code is part of more than just Core - it is also part of Knots, for example.

if avoiding confusion is important to you, refer to it in a manner that reflects the forced segwitting.  perhaps bitcoin settlement? 

of course softforking as a means to cling to the branding is just that. 

bitcoin cash is a hard fork of bitcoin
