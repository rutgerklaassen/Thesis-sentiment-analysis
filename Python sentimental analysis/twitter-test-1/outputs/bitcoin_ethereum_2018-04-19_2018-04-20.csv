There is nothing ""decentralized"" about Vitalik's Ethereum. TheDAO bailout has set a clear precedent that Ethereum Foundation is in full control of this system. Also, Ethereum itself was financed via a mother of all ICOs.

1. When you gossip that ""he loves bitcoin"" do a little research into his master's research and company based on crypto

2. When quoting tweets, verify that the account is not an account setup to promote BLF/ZUMA and smear CR
