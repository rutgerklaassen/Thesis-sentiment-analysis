Bitcoin works:
For & against the law.
For & against politics.
Patents can be good when it protects from other worse interests wanting to patent it. Users will leave if the patents are used against their value.

BSV focus on cornerstone Bitcoin, scaleability & world compatibility.

Based on similar stories, it seems like Greg has been an incredibly patient teacher/mentor over the years to many developers that showed genuine interest, curiosity, and willingness to learn. Hard to overstate how beneficial this has been to Bitcoin as a whole.

8) an ubiquitous and all pervasive confused notion that Bitcoin is/could be an alternative/substitute/competition to actual world money.this is misguided and rather ignorant on many levels,i'd say.suffice to say,if that were even a remote possibility, Bitcoin wouldn't even exist.

How has that been going so far?

The lead developer of ABC (the defacto authority of BABcash) thinks that the current realistic limit is less that 21MB.

The real Bitcoin is currently consistently pumping out blocks much larger than that.

No, you aren't reading. My point is that bitcoin is decentralized until it isn't. While Ripple is centralized until it dies.
