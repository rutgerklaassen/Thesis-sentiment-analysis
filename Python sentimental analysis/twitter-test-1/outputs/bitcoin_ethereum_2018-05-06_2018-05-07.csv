 you emphasized the wrong number.  One is worth over $9000 while the other is less than $2000.  Bitcoin is still better than BCH

Stablecoins are only required if you want to benefit from some features of Bitcoin (e.g. multisignature smart contracts) for fiat-denominated assets.

That's denial of the irrefutable fact that to harness bitcoin's properties, you need to use (thus denominate value in) bitcoins.

It’s Etherium all over again. Another use case that needs immutability therefore it needs bitcoin, but instead is going the scammers route to fake it.

I agree in the sense that *maybe* Bcash will be worth more USD at some point (probably not). But Bitcoin consensus never wavered. Bcash can never ‘become’ Bitcoin any more than an orangutan can become a human being. Bcash forked away forever, while Bitcoin continued onward.
