Your actions have shown that you have control over the overwhelming majority of the hashrate, enough to support evil like NYA/BU. The PoW algorithm should be changed to defeat you, you are an enemy of Bitcoin and freedom, before you start censoring transactions for CCP.

#bitcoin won't be #No1 by the end of the year. #BitcoinPrivate will be in top by end of year.
#ethereum will be #1 by end of year.
#BTC has no new tech to offer.

Wait a minute?  We had a mining monopoly, bitcoin businesses, and one shitty developer attempt to hijack the entire network and we fought them off, and you think that is 'sad and hilarious'? It was probably honey badger's greatest victory in the history of bitcoin.

The race is actually over. Bitcoin is a black hole, the center of which consists of mathematically proven cryptography.

It will absorb all debt-based money until there's nothing left, expanding its Schwarzschild radius until all financial middlemen are consumed.

please make sure not to spam these.  you can do it intelligently and a little bit at a time.  Let these trickle into the public sphere or you risk making yourself look spammy and it turns people off.  Please ask @eosnewyork who would support you but had to mute it as spam! ;)

Ok maybe not, because Bitcoin is a much much much more valuable asset, but Bcash is still a deceptive scam. You don't even have to look at the source code. Just look at the marketing.... Ugh..",,,,,[],https://twitter.com/BitcoinSchiller/status/974794283919335424
