Interesting that The Pirate Bay is still ahead of the curve compared to most Bitcoin exchanges.

Something incredibly easy to roll up online which I yapped at the 
@FBI
 about incessantly back in September, 2017.

Ironically, I think I'd forgotten embedded pornography in bitcoin at that point, but the basic weakness was more critical.

Remember, illegal pornography was the easiest thing to track and shut down.

I raised its inherent weakness with the @FBI along with botnets and bitcoin back in Sept 2017.

They do not pose a threat to Bitcoin. They pose a threat to the fools who buy them. I do not believe we have to wait for natural selection to make them die off, I would rather try to save a few.

The fact is:

Fiat is fraud. 

Taxation is theft. 

Fractional reserve bank is evil. 

The world monetary system is a bubble. 

Bitcoin is the pin.

Definitely disagree.

I have never seen Joe Lubin voice directive guidance around the future direction of Ethereum development. If anything, it is a technocracy at this point, and I am not sure if it is even that as I have seen devs consider community input on several decisions.

I'm not the type to ever do referral codes, but this actually benefits both people. 

They get free bitcoin by using it. So might as well.

basically, this is all the application of existing laws, of the sort that were in place since before bitcoin. If you transmit value that substitutes for currency - and bitcoin is that - then you can money-launder with it, and mixers do quite a bit of that job.

If anything, Joe's incentives are to maximize the adoption and use of Ethereum, and perhaps the value of ETH.

I doubt you would find many ETH holders who find this objectionable. That doesn't necessarily make the system a plutocracy though (influence weighted by total $).

Just because you hadn't heard of CSW doesn't mean things were not happening. It is an established fact that CSW had been conning people close to the Bitcoin Foundation since well before CSW went public. More evidence will come out in the coming weeks, months, years.
