Saying CSW is Satoshi is like saying Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. It's a great project that deserves to be tested, but don't call it what it's not. If one part is FALSE the entire thing is FALSE. That's how Bitcoin works. That's how reality works.

See, in my mind the EVM is what's described in the Jello Paper. Ethereum 2.0 ditches that for a WASM-based VM, and so doesn't have an EVM in that sense.

It's because people always sets arbitrary boundaries to everything. It's human nature. That's why when Bitcoin was at $1, they said it wouldn't reach $10, then it wouldn't reach $100. People also feel that they are smarter when they feel they are ""realistic"" and ""humble""
