I appreciate the thought here and agree that innovation can come from non-traditional approaches.

Small clarification RE ‚Äúacademic‚Äù. I left academia 5 years ago. I don‚Äôt have issues with Ethereum not being academic; it‚Äôs about being ‚Äútechnically sound/rigorous‚Äù.

‚ÄúLearn to code‚Äù offends the emotionally biased individual by suggesting they literally learn logic, antithetical to their perspective.

‚ÄúBuy bitcoin‚Äù offends the statist biased perspective by challenging one‚Äôs assumptions that money is created by the State.

I hope you don't stop making price predictions for Bitcoin. We need legit security analysts to try to price crypto assets, which is extremely difficult.  I give you MAJOR props for building crypto valuation frameworks.  Most wall street types are frankly too scared to even try.

Obviously I'm not reluctant to having additional layers. You keep putting that idea in competition with on-ledger scaling but it's not; they work/multiply together. Bitcoin's the piece of crap it is today because it can't scale on-chain, irrespective of lightning
