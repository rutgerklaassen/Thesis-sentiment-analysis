If you think $440 for Ethereum is low you ain't seen nothing yet. Retail interest keeps going down. Fees are 1 cent per transaction because nobody's using the network. Institutional investors aren't coming in. It's over. $50/ETH will be high when Ethereum starts its death spiral.

It seems almost beyond human capability, though...to sacrifice so much and then walk away from a chance at fortune. This is one of the things that most sets Bitcoin apart...the legendary founder who stepped down and vanished. Totally different type of mindset than being CEO.
