As long as Bitcoin base layer remains decentralized, we do not need cryptocurrency mass adoption for it to succeed...but I do fear another fee crisis before second layers are ready.

Ignis is the first Ardor Child Chain

On 1/5/2019, Coinbase detected a deep chain reorganization of the Ethereum Classic blockchain that included a double spend. In order to protect customer funds, we immediately paused movements of these funds on the ETC blockchain.

Over the course of 50 years you will probabilistically lose 5% of net worth anyway, so it would seem reasonable to “lose it” today to Bitcoin for protection against that potential catastrophe.

Bitcoin may be the only POW chain that survives but what would keep someone from burning 300K per hr. if they could make much more shorting markets & double spend exchanges?
