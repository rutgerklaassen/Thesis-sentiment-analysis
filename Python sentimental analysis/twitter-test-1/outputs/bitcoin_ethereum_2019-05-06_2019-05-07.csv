Many innocent civilians lie dead in the wake of yet another flurry of Israel's brutal missle and mortar attacks in occupied Palestine. It’s an affront to humanity.

This city stands united against this indiscriminate violence and we join the world in mourning the lives lost.

Did he just say he wants ""the transparency of an electronic payment system"" but ""without the dangers of a surveillance state""? That's impossible. The closest you can get is pseudonymity -- you know roughly what people are doing, but not who's doing what. Has he heard of bitcoin?

So all cryptocurrency projects should stop what they are doing and give up because we don't need more than Bitcoin and Ethereum? In theory that's really 'all we need'.

Not all 'privacy' coins are private yet claim to be, we're solving that problem with extensive R&D.

Cheers.

Yes. The mainstream media is pumping out the FUD and their getting Warren Buffet and other Economist to continue to express negative feelings about #bitcoin. Just more talking heads saying repeating the same things they say about $BTC: Illicit use, Dark Web use, not backed, etc
