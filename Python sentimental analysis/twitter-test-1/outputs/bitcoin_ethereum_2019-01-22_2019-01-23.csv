So by 2022, all bitcoin in the world except a fraction will be locked up in BitMEX's insurance fund. With that much BTC off the market, the price per BTC won't be limited to $1m, but rather $1tn. This is actually good for bitcoin.

i assumed that definition of ‚Äúover marketed‚Äù is somewhat similar to overhyped. for example, X project promised to scale & be a platform for Dapps but *not* deliver. $EOS delivered in 7 months on something that Ethereum promised for 3 years now. so why is EOS ‚Äúover marketed‚Äù?
