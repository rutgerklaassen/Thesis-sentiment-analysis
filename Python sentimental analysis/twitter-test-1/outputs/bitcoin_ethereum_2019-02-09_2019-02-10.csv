Just to be clear, my tweet is about #bitcoin. I haven't said anything nor tried to imply anything at all about #xrp.

It's a targeted question based on his tweet to which I am responding.

I also like the introduction of Bitcoin. 7 million people in 37 locations are huge numbers for adoption. I think people should pay attention to Bitcoin and accept it. It's really better than fiat money

Craig is not Satoshi because Satoshi was more that 1 person.  That is a fact.  Also, Craig can't code, so it's obvious he is not the only Satoshi.  And his grasp on Bitcoin and key concepts is highly suspect.  If he was part of Satoshi, he was the idiot of the group.

Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. A software engineer in this industry who is accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars should have known better. I feel bad but, I give no pity. This person should have been leading by example. Much woe.

I used bitcoin to buy a coffee, by the time it went through the vendor had closed and then the  fees cost more than the coffee, The next day I got my coffee in 4 seconds, using XRP and fees less than a penny !

Which is why Jeremy Rubin’s piece on Ethereum economic abstraction was stupid (it’s not enabled intraprotocol, neither is it for Bitcoin), all PoW systems are susceptible to EA via trusted offchain agreements w/ miners.

I've written about #bitcoin and #ethereum, sometimes in critical ways.

""[Ripple] is a big community"". 

Lmao.

You guys try to get your critics banned, that's all. You call all criticism FUD, then blame your actions on others. You guys are just like #iota & #xvg.

Absolutely correct.  Decentralization is why I hodl bitcoin. It's why I believe in it's potential. IMO, long term decentralization is one of the chief foundational issues that must be solved.  More important than speed, transactions fees, etc. If we lose it, we lose everything.

For those that want to learn about economic abstraction we've got a good resource on

. It obviously talks about Ethereum but the same concept applies to Bitcoin.

No, you can't. That's an app to have other people using the network on your behalf with your money. You need a Bitcoin full node to use LN.
