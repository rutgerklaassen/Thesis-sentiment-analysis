The bigger concern is that bitcoin is a ""currency"" that can jump from $2700 to $20,000 to $6,000 over the course of a single year.  That volatility doesn't inspire confidence, especially in light of the revelations that the pump to $20k may have resulted from market manipulation.

Fair critique, and I find it ironic that when bitcoin exhibits low volatility, like a currency, many get upset.

That said, it's still very early days, and bitcoin will remain volatile, but less so  over time.

Thanks for the comment.
