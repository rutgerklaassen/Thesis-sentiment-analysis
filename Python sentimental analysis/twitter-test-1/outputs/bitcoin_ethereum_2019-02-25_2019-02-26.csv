`Bitcoin is way too far ahead.`
Ahead of what? Bitcoin isn't even ahead when it comes to implementing things Core dreams up. #AtomicSwaps #Komodo
`We should be focused on bitcoin and sidechains`
You mean the thing others have already done? #AheadWhenBehind ?

I enjoyed the article, but I don't think it is fair to characterize Decred's governance as ""move fast and break things"". Consensus rule changes go through open review the same way as they do with Bitcoin, with an additional requirement of support from 75% of ticket holders.

If a renewable isn't profitable without Bitcoin, it won't be with it either.

Bitcoin can help keep poorly planned subsidized renewable installations afloat.

But the reason that's the case is ineffective resource allocations by government and hyperactive environmentalism glands.

If governance in #Bitcoin is similar to governance in nation states, who are the deep state actors? Miners, whales, devs? 

Why not make governance more transparent and accessible?

J. Edwards is more focused on the accounting aspects of child trafficking - that is, TOR/dark web money laundering type crap that doesn't flow through typical FDIC insured channels. Makes sense given  rumblings that all the Rosneft transactions (and others) happened via Bitcoin.

I think that black people - can and will do what people did 10 years ago - bought into the idea of economic freedom by acquiring some Bitcoin. This time - they will buy into something that benefits them and black businesses simultaneously.
