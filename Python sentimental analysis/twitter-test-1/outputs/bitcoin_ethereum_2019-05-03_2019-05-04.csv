Facebook is not in a position to lead anymore, it is a dead man walking,  they'll be myspaced sooner than later...

#bitcoin and crypto is so much bigger than that crab people project...

#Facebookcoin would just be another shitcoin between the thousands of other #shitcoins

Too bad Bitcoin is still just a 124 yo global open source grass roots technological monetary social experiment. Damn utopian dream. It will never work.
