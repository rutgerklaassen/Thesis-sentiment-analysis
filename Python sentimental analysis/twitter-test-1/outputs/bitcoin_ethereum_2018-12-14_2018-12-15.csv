It's ""Bitcoin"" actually. It's a colourless, odourless protocol with great disintermediating properties and no one can do anything to stop it. Deal with it, though but perhaps learn how it works before spouting piffle on Twitter.

A chain split with around 50/50 hashpower, even as close as the recent BCH fork, would cause some uncertainty about which one is (going to be) the real Bitcoin. No?
