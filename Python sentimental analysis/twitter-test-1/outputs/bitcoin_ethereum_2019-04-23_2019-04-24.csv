>Bitcoin is a gambling technology
All acts are speculative.  A HS senior speculates taking on debt and deferring income, to go to university, will lead to higher future value.  Nocoiners speculate stock/bonds will out perform Bitcoin.  Do you reject this argument?

only people who suffered repeatedly through the bear market get this. I bought early December 2017, felt the highs, then got crushed trying to trade in 2018. Slow accumulation of bitcoin and maybe a handful of other projects will beat trading over the next couple of bulls, 100%

It’s not quite that way but yes, tainted bitcoin can be seen as less valuable. On the same hand, Bitcoin with a low number of inputs (early, unmoved bitcoin) are also worth more.

Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, et al. are #PoS supporters, both the figurative and literal meaning of the acronym. They're not capitalists, they're just paid to promote propaganda for very specific reasons, eg. monopoly. Bitcoin (BSV) was built specifically to combat them.

People saving in Bitcoin are doing so because of the very real possibility that is may become fully monetized. 

The logical flaw above is that such a monetization must necessarily happen in a predictable, low volatility way, but that is delusional.

The bigger issue here is that the idea that a secret meeting of a select few would have the potential to change Bitcoin is the most concerning thing of the whole blocksize debate. Much bigger issue in my mind than fees or blockchain bloat.
