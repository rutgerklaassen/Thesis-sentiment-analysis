Not so sure what I've done recently to be deserving because I'm mostly just observing, and I'm singing the bear market blues. The time to get excited will come again but I suspect a long sideways consolidation first. Thanks all the same!

That's one example indeed. Ethereum is full of interdependencies. The on- and off-chain software ecosystem is huge. And the nature of software research/development is such that throwing more people or money around just doesn't help. It takes raw time and effort to grow ecosystem.

As a software engineer with well over 15 years of professional experience, I can assure you that it doesn't even approach a copy/paste operation. And even if a copy manages to launch, it's still lacking the synergy with the rest of the Ethereum ecosystem.
