Literally months of mental tension dissolved for me when I finally got it. All the anguish and hand-wringing tells me that many bitcoiners still don't actually understand how bitcoin works. The lesson may be hard but it needs to be learned for us to progress.

Chainlink will be able to aggregate responses off-chain and transmit a single response to a smart contract to be settled on Ethereum. A cost-effective approach b/c the amount of data transmitted determines the cost of the message. #SmartContracts $LINK

A fraud has no problem promising you one thing, and then completely going back on his word.

With CSW, we have a fraudster trying to assume full control over the Bitcoin (yes) protocol.

Yes I'm in the cult. Have you listened to what is his drive? What he wants to achieve? It's very ambitious, but also very admirable goal. I think he is the only one focusing on one coin. He doesn't want alts. He wants Bitcoin to be everything and elsewhere. I share this vision.

there are no guarantees. there would still be taking risks in a world of the bitcoin standard just like there was risk in the world of the gold standard. But you eliminate money supply expansion risk, which is just theft/expropriation by another word.

You‚Äôre completely ignoring the fact that the 21m cap for bitcoin is just a dream about the future with no proof it can work.  All that we know is today $125 worth of bitcoin is printed to pay miners for every $1 of transaction fees paid by users. Will users ever foot the bill?

Well nobody's stopping anyone from storing all of their wealth in gold/bitcoin/whatever today. You can avoid the mild (and largely predictable) inflation risk in favor of any risk you'd like.
