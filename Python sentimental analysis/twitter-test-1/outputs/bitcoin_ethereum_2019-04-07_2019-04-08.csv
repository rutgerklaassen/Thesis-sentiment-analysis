Did a small update on various ALTs vs USD - $ETH, $LTC, $EOS, $ADA and other.

Tldr : a lot of resistances have been broken. Not out of the woods just yet, with big bro #Bitcoin near 6k resistance.

Last year, I had to come up with a significant sum of money to pay up-front for rent. I had 1 day to convert Bitcoin into physical dollars, else I was to lose the apartment we need to settle in Argentina. I was able to find someone with LocalBitcoins.

The problem is that there is so much to get.  The next hurdle is understanding that using centralized sources to provide inputs for decentralized #smartcontracts is terrible idea and negates many of the benefits of #blockchain in the first place.  No single points of failure!

A few months before that, I underwent a last-minute surgery, not life threatening, but important. Again, I was able to find a counterparty to sell Bitcoin securely with LocalBitcoins. Also used localethereum in the clinic from my phone because an unexpected situation arised.

As for people who accept it, see 
@paywithzcash
. Note that according to https://recordedfuture.com/dark-web-currency/…, Zcash isn't widely accepted on the dark web. Probably use Bitcoin for that.
