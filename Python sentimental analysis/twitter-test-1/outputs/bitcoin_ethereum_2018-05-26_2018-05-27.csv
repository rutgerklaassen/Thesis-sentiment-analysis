Exactly the reason i posted this, but this time, Bitcoin is already here and will explode. A lot of rich people will  hedge into crypto to maintain their wealth.

1. Its block history goes back to the bitcoin Genesis block.
2. Its user base of holders, miners includes all people who got into bitcoin since 2009.
3. It contained the bitcoin code base as at Aug17 - minus artificial block cap
4 It closely adheres to the original white paper.

Actually, you could troll Satoshi the first 1.5 year or so of Bitcoin's existence as well. He was active on the bitcointalk forums.

Not really, no. Bitcoin remove all the middlemens, you don't have to trust anybody, you just have to trust your own node. Here, you need to trust the issuers which render the whole concept pointless.

The price of power for bitcoin mining should increase at the same rate as bitcoin so that it can never become profitable.

We called the ""housing bubble"" a bubble (and fairly so). I'm a Bitcoin proponent, but I'm fine calling late-2017 a Bitcoin bubble and perfectly fine calling most of the alt coin market a volcano-like bubble at varying levels of eruption.

I don't believe in accusations of malice towards nChain or that they ""do nothing"". Whether or not you mistrust their patents, they have also invested into the Bitcoin ecology, into businesses like 
@lokad
  and 
@CentbeeWallet
 which helps BCH adoption to the mainstream.

Basically Bitcoin is backed by ‚Äúuncheatable‚Äù math that manages the supply automatically over time, as opposed to traditional money, where groups of people manipulate the price fraudently. The dollar has no intrinsic value because it‚Äôs not backed by anything, unlike BTC.
