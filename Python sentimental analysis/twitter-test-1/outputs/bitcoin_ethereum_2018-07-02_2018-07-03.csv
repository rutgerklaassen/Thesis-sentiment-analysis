Except for destroying hash rate and therefore making attacks on bitcoin cheap? That's a heck of an exception.

And destroying everyone that has already investing in creating ASICs is going to encourage future competitors that profits are reliable?

For there to be some sort of claim it wasn‚Äôt promoted & people secretly mined it then you‚Äôd easily see that in the hash rate ‚Äî within 4 weeks there were a dozen pools ‚Äî issuance rate is exactly the same halving schedule as Bitcoin - so you are talking less than 0.5% of supply

OK. This is a fundamental copy of $XLM and $XRP and relies on Bitcoin as a fail safe, if UNL's or quorum fail. A reinvention at the cost of SegWit $BTC. 
Please also note that there is also $KMD Asset Chains, with similar accomplishments minus the block-size crippling.
