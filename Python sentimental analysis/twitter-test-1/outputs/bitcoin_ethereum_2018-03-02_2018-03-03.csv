Both systems could be adjusted to remain secure and usable if such thing happen. But nobody has the power to decide what happens, so it's virtually impossible to predict what would really happen. Just as people might have once predicted bitcoin block size could easily be raised.

Except, we did not take a risk, you did. If your portfolio is not up over 300% this year then you should listen to what I say. I expect you are down by lets say ...YUUUGE? If Bitcoin dropped to $3000 you would have lost a lot. We don't use crystal balls, we manage risk.

It's extremely hard to know because it requires knowing how other people's nodes are configured and what their risk tolerance is. It's like trying to predict what would happen to bitcoin if all mining in China mysteriously ceased. Hard to know what people would do.
