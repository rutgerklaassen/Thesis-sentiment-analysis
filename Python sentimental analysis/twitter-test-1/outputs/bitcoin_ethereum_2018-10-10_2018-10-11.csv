Decentralized ride sharing apps with high-volume, low-value transactions are a ways out given Ethereum's current limitations; decentralized home sharing apps are more possible in the short term, in addition to many other two-sided marketplaces. We're also excited about layer 2!

Maximalist is just a meme anyway. 

Some Maximalists like me enjoy some alts but believe Bitcoin is the ultimate winner as store of value and has the best shot at becoming a global reserve currency.

Some maximalists are more like extremists who think everything else is a scam.

Pretending that just because something is voluntary means that it is not a scam is obviously stupid.

Other cryptocurrencies that don't have a chance to compete with bitcoin in a winner take all game are ""designed"" to be scams.
