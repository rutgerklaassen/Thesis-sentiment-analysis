Its 2047, the People‚Äôs Republic of Badguys is shutting down nodes. Hiro Protagonist will have his VR world wiped out if he doesn‚Äôt come up with .0172 Bitcoin in a week. A huge sum.
Fortunately his uncle has digital securities for a Irish tech stock to trade for BTC via satellite.

Let's explore ‚Äúin-fighting,‚Äù lessons learned from failed forks, dispel forking FUD, and highlight benefits of Bitcoin‚Äôs informal governance.

We should all just recognize that we agree that it‚Äôs wrong to harm people. 

This argument is about 95% over labels, titles and symbols. Words and definitions matter, but they don‚Äôt matter more than people.

if you manage to explain what Crony-Capitalism is to Ed you'll 'win'. As it is, he thinks its a made up word, so he constantly confuses Capitalism with Crony-capitalism. It's like trying to get a colour blind person to see 2 colours when they can only perceive one.
