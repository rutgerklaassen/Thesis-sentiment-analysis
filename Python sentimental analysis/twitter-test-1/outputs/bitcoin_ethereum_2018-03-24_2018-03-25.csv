Altcoin boom cycles happen because marketers, entrepreneurs and others with a mindset of making money have a super low barrier to entry.

Ethereum removed the ‚Äútechnology‚Äù from blockchain technology and allowed anyone to run an ICO to raise 10s of millions with stupid ideas.

Ok, let's say you are 100% correct and it is self-defeating not to listen to you,  a Bitcoin Core ""conference"" is not the appropriate venue because it's all about the details of software development. There are lots of other conferences for political economy like Satoshi's Vision.
