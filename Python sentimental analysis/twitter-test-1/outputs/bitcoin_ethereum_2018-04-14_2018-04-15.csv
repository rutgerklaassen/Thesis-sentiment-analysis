If we assume Bitcoin wins as top global politically stable currency. Then it will be massive. 

However, if we look at market cap of financial assets in general, derivatives are bigger then currency. 

Is there such a thing as a crypto derivative? 

Or is this apples vs oranges?

As far as accelerating it goes I think the best strategy is to help contribute to:

1. Lightning 
2. Confidential transactions 
3. Smart contracts on bitcoin (Simplicity).

If you can’t help directly you might be able to build a wallet, or other related app.
