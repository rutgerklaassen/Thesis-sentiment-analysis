BULLISH!!

..Or... Hold 8700-8900 until daily candle close then we get a wicked bearish candle tomorrow to fall back into the long term trend line and have a major fake out.

So far my targets of 8500 and 9k region hit.

Everything is overbought right now.

You sound bitter. Did you sell your BCH?

If you hold both BTC and BCH, you don't have to worry whether the original Bitcoin design (BCH) or Blockstream's design (BTC) is best.
