I'm wondering which side @Bitcoin is gonna take.
Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Cash SV or Bitcoin Cash ABC?

ABC/BU is moving away from the whitepaper, this is the exact argument we had with Core.  Yes you have the support of exchanges and developers in the industry, but that doesn't define what Bitcoin is, the whitepaper does.  If you want side-chains, fork off.  Otherwise hash-war.

You think startups will start learning Bitcoin to build their apps? You gotta give them one-line API calls that handle everything for them. Period.
