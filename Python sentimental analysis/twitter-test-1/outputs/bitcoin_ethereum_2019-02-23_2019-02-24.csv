Dude. You are defensive against people who are not attacking you.

You assume that paying for storage somehow makes bitcoin bad, ir broken. That is Not what I said.

It won't be free.
That is ok.
Paying for useful stuff is a good thing.

I only use non-custodial wallets. The one you should use depends on 1) how much bitcoin you have 2) how you want to use it, i.e. storage vs. spending 3) how technically adept you are.

There are some good ones listed here: https://lopp.net/bitcoin.html

Well 90% of the mining is in China and apparently it‚Äôs all this energy and thus all these emissions and so if they stop the bitcoin they stopped all those emissions.

This is totally going to happen.
